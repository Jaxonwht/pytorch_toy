democratic friend -- we just found out today that my opponent lent himself yet another million dollars .
democratic that brings him to $ 11.5 million he ’ s given to himself to tell lies about me on tv .
democratic braun ’ s money goes straight from his bank account to tv stations so he can blanket the airwaves with lies .
democratic that ’ s exactly what they are : he says he wants to protect people with pre-existing conditions , but he ’ s supported every major proposal that would take them away .
democratic he says he took on the insurance companies to provide his employees with good health care .
democratic the truth : his employees have to pay $ 10,000 out of pocket before braun ’ s health insurance covers their families .
democratic we can ’ t trust rep .
democratic braun to stand up for us in washington .
democratic but with all this personal money he ’ s sinking into ads , hoosiers could start to believe his lies if we don ’ t fight back with the truth .

democratic → last year when mitch mcconnell passed massive tax cuts for the wealthiest americans , he said they would “ pay for themselves . ”
democratic now mcconnell is calling for cuts to social security and medicare to pay for his tax giveaway .
democratic if he and his republican allies like martha mcsally win in november , that ’ s what they ’ ll do .
democratic friend , we can ’ t let that happen.contribute now to stand up mcconnell ’ s threats to our earned benefits -- and stop martha mcsally from implementing mcconnell ’ s dangerous agenda .
democratic chip in to stop mcconnell last week we found out that mcsally has received more than $ 13 million in support from mcconnell and his allies during this campaign alone .
democratic it ’ s not hard to see why : we know from her voting record that she ’ ll be a rubber stamp for mcconnell if she gets elected .
democratic kyrsten has fought to protect medicare and social security , and she ’ ll do the same as a u.s.
democratic we cannot let martha mcsally win -- there is simply too much at stake .

democratic i get it : there ’ s a lot going on in the news right now .
democratic and there are a lot of competitive , must-win elections that ’ ll come down to the wire on november 6th .
democratic sometimes , it ’ s hard to know where to focus your energy .
democratic well , i ’ d like to make that job a little easier for you today .
democratic let ’ s just zoom in on three wonderful progressive house candidates – as part of our grassroots army ’ s push to get great democrats elected across the country.here ’ s who needs your help today to boost democrats ’ chances of taking back the house : chris pappas in new hampshire , lizzie pannill fletcher in texas , and lauren baer in florida .
democratic can you chip in right now to help fuel their campaigns – and help democrats win power in washington ?
democratic chris pappas ( nh-01 ) grew up working in a local restaurant his family has owned for four generations .
democratic that ’ s where chris learned the importance of good-paying jobs , workers ’ rights , economic growth ( and the secret to his grandfather ’ s world-famous chicken tenders ) .
democratic today , he manages the family restaurant and serves on the new hampshire executive council , where he helped expand medicaid for 53,000 working families and reverse the 2012 decision to defund planned parenthood , providing family planning services and cancer screenings for more than 13,000 people in his state .
democratic if elected , chris would become new hampshire ’ s first openly gay congressman .
democratic let ’ s help him make history and flip this seat.lizzie pannill fletcher ( tx-07 ) is a proud houstonian , and you might not know this , but that city has a special place in my heart .
democratic i got my second chance at an education at the university of houston – for $ 50 a semester .
democratic later , i taught at uh .
democratic lizzie will fight for people to have the opportunities that we had .
democratic as a lawyer , she ’ s helped solve real problems for houstonians from all kinds of backgrounds – who work in oil fields , hospitals , boardrooms , and small businesses .
democratic she was her firm ’ s first woman partner .
democratic and she ’ s ready to keep fighting for houstonians – so let ’ s help make sure she wins.lauren baer ( fl-18 ) is an attorney and foreign policy expert who spent six years in public service as a senior advisor to two secretaries of state in the obama administration .
democratic she oversaw big projects to make government work better and engage everyday people .
democratic in congress , she ’ ll fight for quality affordable health care , excellent public schools , and sensible foreign policy .
democratic if we help her win in november , she ’ d be the first member of the lgbtq community ever to represent florida in congress .
democratic she ’ s not taking any money from corporate pacs – so she needs our grassroots army to step up for her.chris , lizzie , and lauren would make outstanding members of congress .
democratic they ’ ll work for working people – not giant corporations .
democratic but that means their races won ’ t be easy .
democratic they ’ re fighting their hearts out against powerful interests with deep pockets .
democratic let ’ s have their backs .
democratic can chris , lizzie , and lauren count on you ?
democratic please chip in $ 3 , or whatever you can afford , to help send chris pappas , lizzie pannill fletcher , and lauren baer to congress .
democratic every donation will help these democrats in tough races across the country .

democratic huge news , friends : a new poll has us taking the lead in our race that will decide senate control !
democratic but rick scott isn &apos;t giving up – he responded by donating another $ 23.3 million this month from his personal fortune to reclaim the lead and defeat me .
democratic we have 7 days left to decide control of the senate , and it all comes down to this race .
democratic if we want to stop scott from buying this seat , we need every dollar – every single dollar you can spare – to turn out enough democrats to regain the senate majority .
democratic that &apos;s why a group of donors is matching every dollar given before midnight to protect florida &apos;s senate seat .
democratic but with just four hours left , we &apos;re still $ 10,000 short .
democratic please , friends , if we fall short today , we &apos;ll lose in florida and stay stuck in the senate minority for two more years .

democratic we are in the lead right now – but we &apos;re running short on cash , and if we don &apos;t raise $ 45,000 immediately , our ads will go dark and our voter turnout operation will collapse .
democratic this lead will disappear unless you give right now , team : please , will you donate $ 1 – before our midnight deadline – to win in nevada and take back the senate for democrats ?
democratic these early-voting numbers have republicans really worried : even fox news is saying that this could hurt the gop &apos;s chance at keeping control of the senate .
democratic that means republicans are going to do everything they can to defeat us in nevada .
democratic mitch mcconnell has already spent $ 22 million to keep his grip on senate control – and with a recent poll showing us within 1 point , we have zero room for error .

democratic friends -- 20 i am no stranger to close elections -- in my first race for the arizona state house , i won my primary by just 445 votes .
democratic in my final race for the house of representatives , i won by just over one percent of all ballots cast .
democratic there are going to be a lot of close races this election -- races that will determine whether or not we elect a congress that is willing to stand up to this president and to the gun lobby , or if we are going to have two more years of the status quo .
democratic the truth is , the democratic national committee is one of the few organizations large enough and nimble enough to effectively direct the resources we need to win to take back congress in these final days of the race .
democratic so today , i want to ask you to do something very important in our fight to elect a congress that will move us forward , a congress with the courage to stand up to the gun lobby : can you split a $ 10 donation between the democratic national committee &apos;s critical work electing democrats who will stand up to donald trump and the work of my organization , giffords pac , taking on the gun lobby to make our communities safer from gun violence ?
democratic donate : $ 10donate : $ 25donate : $ 50donate : $ 100donate : $ 200or donate another amount .
democratic the gun lobby and those who benefit from one-party rule in washington , d.c. are not going to give up without a fight .
democratic they will spend virtually unlimited sums of money to protect the status quo .
democratic the only thing standing in their way is what we &apos;re willing to do about it .
democratic if you chip in to support the dnc , i believe that we will win .

democratic friends – trump was just in florida for the second time this week campaigning for his handpicked candidate , rick scott .
democratic trump knows how high the stakes are , saying that if we lose , democrats &quot; have no chance at taking back the senate . &quot;
democratic now , with just two days until the election , our fundraising has slowed down – and that needs to change quickly .
democratic every single dollar we raise today will go toward our turnout operation tomorrow .
democratic so if we don &apos;t bounce back today , rick scott will win on tuesday – and trump will keep senate control .
democratic we &apos;re making our final budget decisions in the morning , and with the latest poll showing us tied , we need to get $ 100,000 in the door today if we want to avoid cutting back – but we &apos;re still short .
democratic senate control is on the line , so your gift right now could be the difference between a democratic and a republican senate : please , rush $ 5 immediately to help fight back against trump and scott , defend florida &apos;s senate seat and take back the senate for democrats .
democratic if you &apos;ve saved payment information with actblue express , your donation will go through immediately : donate $ 5 donate $ 25 donate $ 50 other amount thank you , bill this email was sent to politicalemaildatabase @ gmail.com.

democratic friends : today , for the last time , your dollar will go twice as far – but we only have five hours left until our midnight deadline , and we &apos;re on pace to miss our final match goal .
democratic a recent poll showed us leading by 1 point in the race that will decide control of the senate .
democratic but rick scott won &apos;t give up : he &apos;s spent more than $ 12 million in just the past nine days to try to defeat me .
democratic that &apos;s why this final match is so important .
democratic democratic turnout is not where it needs to be , and we still need another $ 17,000 to hit our match goal and protect florida &apos;s senate seat .
democratic early voting is about to end , rick scott is pouring in more money every day , and control of the senate is on the line .
democratic missing this goal will drastically decrease our chances of winning , so i need you to give whatever you can spare before midnight and have it doubled to take back the senate .
democratic time is running out : rush $ 5 – before this final match expires at midnight – and have it doubled to defend florida &apos;s senate seat and take back the senate for democrats .
democratic if you &apos;ve saved payment information with actblue express , your donation will go through immediately : donate $ 5 ( becomes $ 10 ) donate $ 25 ( becomes $ 50 ) donate $ 50 ( becomes $ 100 ) other amount thank you , bill this email was sent to politicalemaildatabase @ gmail.com.

democratic after mitch mcconnell told the washington post that the battle for senate control runs through florida , rick scott and the gop have spent more than $ 90 million to try to defeat me !
democratic now nate silver &apos;s fivethirtyeight has moved our must-win race from &quot; leans democrat &quot; to &quot; toss-up &quot; – and if we lose , democrats have no chance of taking back the senate .
democratic thankfully , we just got some amazing news : a group of generous donors offered to double all gifts to help us pull ahead and hit our critical $ 100,000 goal .
democratic can i count on you to rush $ 5 ( becomes $ 10 ) or more to protect florida &apos;s senate seat and take back the senate ?
democratic the only way democrats can take back the senate is by winning our race in florida – but if we miss this fundraising goal , we could lose .
democratic that &apos;s why taking advantage of this match is crucial – whatever you give will go twice as far to help defend florida &apos;s senate seat .
democratic but time &apos;s running out , and we &apos;re still way short of what we need .
democratic control of the senate for the next two years is on the line , and your gift could be the difference between winning and losing – so i &apos;m counting on you to give whatever you can before our huge deadline : give $ 5 or more now and have it doubled to win in florida and take back the senate for democrats !

democratic if we want to stop scott from buying this seat , we need every dollar – every single dollar you can spare – to turn out enough democrats to regain the senate majority .

democratic friend , last week , i campaigned in florida with my friend and colleague senator bill nelson who is locked in one of the closest senate races in the country .
democratic most experts agree that we won &apos;t take back the senate unless bill wins in florida .
democratic in fact , politico reported , &quot; a loss in florida would all but relegate democrats to the senate minority for at least another two years . &quot;
democratic i &apos;ve said it many times : the upcoming midterm election is the most important election of our lifetime – and with the election only 8 days away , we can &apos;t waste any time.will you join me in supporting bill nelson by making a small contribution to his campaign today ?
democratic most polls in the race have bill neck and neck with his opponent , governor rick scott – so we can &apos;t afford to sit on the sidelines .
democratic scott and his gop allies have now spent more than $ 90 million against bill – including $ 64 million that scott personally gave to his own campaign – and they &apos;ve shown no signs of slowing down.we need to show them that the power of the people is always greater than the people in power .
democratic if you &apos;ve saved payment information with actblue express , your donation will go through immediately : donate $ 5 donate $ 25 donate $ 50 other amount i &apos;m doing everything i can to help my friend bill nelson , and i &apos;d like to ask you to do the same .
democratic every vote , every dollar – every little bit can help make a difference in this close , must-win race.please join me today in supporting bill and help take back the senate for democrats .
democratic thank you for your support . – cory this email was sent to politicalemaildatabase @ gmail.com.

democratic i have been honored and humbled that you have placed your faith in me to serve over the years and that you are trusting me to serve another term as your senator .
democratic this election has been a battle for what kind of country we want to be and whether we as a nation will fulfill our most basic obligation : to pursue justice on behalf of families , workers and the vulnerable .
democratic the republican-controlled congress and this president have led our nation down a dark path best summed up with three words : fear , smear and divide .
democratic whether by undermining access to quality , affordable health care or by enacting a tax law that gives away the store to the super rich and big corporations , this administration and its allies have turned their backs on our families , our workers and the vulnerable.tonight , with your votes , you said enough .
democratic you did it because we &apos;re americans .
democratic we take care of each other , and we care about one another .
democratic despite all our challenges , despite all the troubles before us , there is something exceptional about our nation .
democratic together as americans , and only together , we can solve any problem , meet every challenge and overcome every obstacle .
democratic i &apos;m honored to stand with you in that fight .

democratic 20 we &apos;re getting worried , team .
democratic bob &apos;s opponent , congressman lou barletta , is catching up .
democratic the numbers from his last fundraising report show that he is within striking distance of bob , and that &apos;s scary for a few reasons .
democratic congressman barletta admitted in last week &apos;s debate that he would cut programs like medicare , medicaid and social security in order to pay for this administration &apos;s corporate tax cut .
democratic vp pence was just in pennsylvania this week , singing barletta &apos;s praises and saying how much president trump needs him as an ally in the senate .
democratic there are only 11 days left to fight back and protect bob .
democratic this administration wants to turn pa red again this year and make sure their friend barletta gets elected to the senate .
democratic if he wins , he will be another vote to help pass their divisive , anti-middle-class agenda .
democratic we can &apos;t let that happen.we need to make sure congressman barletta doesn &apos;t outraise bob in these last 11 days -- can you give $ 5 or more to help protect bob ?

democratic recent polls show our race deadlocked , and rick scott and the gop are bombarding florida with more than $ 75 million in attack ads to try to buy this seat .

democratic friend , we ’ ve seen the polls tighten to just a few points .
democratic we ’ ve seen big name republicans like donald trump , mike pence , and marco rubio fly in to minnesota to fundraise and rally their base to defeat me .
democratic and we ’ ve seen our opponent launch attack after attack to try to stop us .
democratic they have money and power , but what matters now is how much energy you bring to fight back .
democratic i truly believe that a grassroots campaign can take on any odds , defeat anything set against them .
democratic but that means i ’ m counting on you to be the difference .
democratic every night we check our fundraising totals to see if we met our daily goal --- and my team tells me we still need to raise $ 12,000 to stay on track for today .
democratic can i count on you to pitch in before midnight ?
democratic hitting this goal is how we keep our ads on the air and fund everything we need to get out the vote over the next 14 days .
democratic donate now we can take on everything they are throwing against us , stop republicans from turning this senate seat red , and stop trump ’ s extreme agenda in washington -- but it ’ s going to take a true people-powered movement to do it .
democratic i ’ m counting on you .

democratic friends – early voting is about to end in florida , and reports show democratic turnout is not where it needs to be .
democratic the polls have us tied with right-wing extremist rick scott in the race that will decide senate control – and we &apos;re running out of time to take the lead .
democratic so i need your help : a group of donors is doubling all gifts for the last time ever in our campaign – up to our $ 250,000 goal – to take back the senate .
democratic but we &apos;re falling short : please , will you give $ 5 now and have your donation go twice as far to defend florida &apos;s senate seat and take back the senate ?
democratic our fundraising took a major hit last week , so we &apos;ve set a goal of raising $ 250,000 by midnight to fund an aggressive turnout operation during these crucial final days .
democratic with politico saying democrats cannot take back the senate with a loss in florida , senate control is riding on this fundraising goal .
democratic but your last chance ever to have your donation doubled is about to expire , and we &apos;re still falling short .
democratic we have four days left in this campaign , and with rick scott still pouring in millions to tip the scales , i &apos;m counting on grassroots supporters like you to help protect florida &apos;s senate seat and take back the senate by giving right now .
democratic please friends , we will never get an opportunity like this again : rush $ 5 right now ( becomes $ 10 for the last time ever ) to have twice the impact on defending florida &apos;s senate seat , defeating rick scott and taking back the senate for democrats .

democratic but politico says regaining senate control depends on winning in florida – and with nearly 3 million votes already cast and more coming in every day , rick scott just wrote himself $ 23 million in the last three weeks to try to save the gop &apos;s senate majority.our fundraising slowed way down over the weekend , and we &apos;re about to run out of money for our final tv ads campaign .
democratic going off the air now , in the most crucial moment of this campaign , could cost us this race – and hand senate control to the gop .
democratic we need to raise $ 100,000 by 7 p.m. to keep our ads live and time is running out , so i &apos;m asking for your help .

democratic this is bad , friends .
democratic millions of floridians have already voted , senate control is on the line and my team just told me that we &apos;ve missed our fundraising goal five days in a row in the most important senate race in the country.losing in florida would leave democrats with zero chance of a senate majority .
democratic but unless something changes right now , we won &apos;t have the money we need to win this race .
democratic missing these goals means we still need another $ 20,000 by 7 p.m. to keep our ads from going dark – and pulling them down with eight days left would cost us this election .

democratic that &apos;s why we &apos;ve set a goal to raise another $ 150,000 ahead of our criti cal deadline .
democratic with just hours left until midnight , my team let me know we &apos;r e still about $ 48,825 short of what we need to take back the senate by winn ing in north dakota .
democratic 20 graham , there should be no doubt in new jerseyans &apos; minds about where bob hugin stands and who he really supports .
democratic 20 here is a hint : ( it &apos;s donald trump ) we wanted to make sure to leave no doubt about hugin &apos;s undying support for president trump so we are releasing a new ad in the final days of this election .
democratic 20 check out our latest ad and then chip in $ 5 or more to help us spread it across new jersey so voters know the truth about hugin and his undying loyalty to donald trump .
democratic donate look , it &apos;s no secret : hugin has donated over $ 200,000 to trump &apos;s campaign and super pac , he was a trump delegate in 2016 and even served as his new jersey state finance chair .
democratic hugin supported both of trump &apos;s supreme court nominees .
democratic he supported trump &apos;s attempts to repeal the affordable care act .
democratic and he refused to stand up to trump after his attacks against women and his racist and derogatory comments toward minorities across the country .
democratic 20 while democratic senator bob menendez will stand up to trump , we know that bob hugin would just be a rubber stamp for his agenda .
democratic 20 we need to ensure that every single voter knows the truth about hugin &apos;s support for trump before they cast their vote on november 6th .
democratic so check out our latest ad and then chip in $ 5 or more to help us spread it as far as possible .

democratic breaking , team : democrats have an early lead in nevada &apos;s race for senate control !
democratic fox news says early voter turnout just hit a record high for a midterm – and that means we have a real chance to take back the senate for democrats !
democratic we cannot afford to lose this momentum just days before election day – but we need to keep our ads on the air in nevada , and we &apos;re dangerously close to missing our goal .
democratic the gop is panicking – even fox news is saying that these early voting numbers could hurt their chances of winning senate control .
democratic but if we don &apos;t hit this $ 65,000 goal in one hour , we will hand republicans their chance to retake the lead and defeat us in nevada .
democratic we cannot let that happen , team !

democratic and right now , we don &apos;t have the resources we need to fight back .
democratic our fundraising has plummeted : we fell way short yesterday and spent our bank account down to zero to reach as many democrats as possible .
democratic but gop voter turnout was high , and there &apos;s no way we can fight back for the final two days if we miss another goal .
democratic we &apos;re within 1 point , and we &apos;ve still got a chance to take back senate control by winning in nevada – but only if you step up and help us meet our goal .

democratic the philadelphia inquirer has endorsed democratic senator bob menendez &apos;s re-election campaign .
democratic after reviewing all that senator menendez has done for our state and the full slate of his achievements , there was no other choice.just look at what they had to say - then chip in $ 5 right now to help us get out the vote in these crucial final weeks before election day .
democratic donate our opponent has run his negative campaign on what he can do for trump , not the people of new jersey .
democratic he has failed masterfully at showing exactly what he would do to fight for affordable health care , to protect a woman &apos;s right to choose , to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals , or to ensure that social security or medicare would be protected from cuts .
democratic senator menendez has proven time and time again that he is committed to fighting for the issues that you care about and will continue to do so if re-elected.so help us spread the news about this new endorsement by chipping in $ 5 or more right now and together we will make sure every voter in new jersey casts their vote on november 6th .

democratic so we have to make a statement in these last two weeks .
democratic everyone is going to be looking at how many hoosiers we can reach to determine whether we have a fighting chance .
democratic braun already has the advantage -- after all , he has president trump , vice president pence , and mitch mcconnell on his side .

democratic it &apos;s alarming.my race against josh hawley and his billionaire backers is still a toss-u p ( most polls actually show him just slightly ahead ) , and the election is only four days away .
democratic we &apos;re running out of time to pull out a wi n , and i know we can &apos;t do it without your help.the best way to win at this point is to turn out e very. last. voter .
democratic we need to close this $ 12,000 fundraising gap now so we can send our volunteers out knocking doors this weekend and reach every single missourian before i t &apos;s too late.if you give now , your gift will go three times as far – and every cent will go out the door tomorrow to turn out voters and protect our democratic senate seat .

democratic we ’ ve set a goal to raise $ 125,000 by then so we have what it takes to power our campaign for these final days.can you chip in now to help us get there ?
democratic here ’ s why this goal is so important : polls say this race is a dead heat .
democratic mitch mcconnell is launching millions in attack ads against kyrsten .
democratic we ’ re running out of time to pull ahead .
democratic we can win this election , but only if you step up to help us hit our critical october fundraising goal .
democratic can we count on you for a contribution of $ 3 or more ?
democratic contribute $ 3 → mcconnell is all in on this race because he wants another rubber stamp for his agenda in the senate -- and he knows that ’ s what martha mcsally will be .
democratic mcconnell and his mega-donor friends have already spent more than $ 25 million boosting kyrsten ’ s opponent -- and with just eight days left , his attacks will only get worse .
democratic but we know that this grassroots team is ready to step up and help us meet this end-of-month fundraising goal so we can fight back against the attacks and win.we ’ re counting on you , friend .
democratic please contribute $ 3 or whatever you can afford now .

democratic friend , this is urgen t : analysts at the washington post just increased heidi heitkamp &apos;s chanc es of losing in north dakota .
democratic and if heidi loses here , democrats have zero chance at taking back the senate .
democratic that &apos; s why a mitch mcconnell-linked super pac is spending millions to defeat hei di and tighten the gop &apos;s hold on the senate .
democratic and now , nate silve r &apos;s fivethirtyeight is predicting that a north dakota voter will be up to 3 0 times likelier to determine senate control – so we know the attacks are only starting .
democratic senate co ntrol is on the line , so whether we raise another $ 250,000 before midnight tonight could determine control of the senate for the next two years .
democratic we cannot afford to miss this goal – but we &apos;r e running out of time , and heidi &apos;s counting on your immediate contribution : please , will you rush $ 5 or more right now – every dollar you can – to win in north d akota so we can take back the senate for democrats ?

democratic folks – i ’ m going to get straight to the point , because there is simply no time to waste .
democratic there ’ s only 15 days until election day and the path we take as a country is on the line .
democratic you know how important taking back the senate is , i know how important taking back the senate is – so there ’ s no need to dance around it .
democratic we ’ ve got to get this country back on track and helping my friend , bill nelson in florida is how we can do that , together.before i tell you a little bit about bill and what he ’ s up against , i ’ m asking if you would be able to give $ 5 to help him in his election that could decide control of the senate , because we don ’ t have a moment to spare .

democratic i ’ ve worked with bill , and he ’ s a good man .
democratic i ’ ve stood side-by-side with him in the senate and could always count on him to stand up for middle-class americans .
democratic i didn ’ t have to convince him that we needed to help people struggling to come back from the worst economic recession of our lifetimes .
democratic i didn ’ t have to convince him that we needed to pass the violence against women act .
democratic i didn ’ t have to convince him that we needed help people have access to affordable , high-quality health care or that we needed to protect our water and environment .
democratic he knew it was the right thing to do , and that ’ s what he does – he puts politics aside and does what ’ s best for the people of florida and our nation .
democratic he always has and he always will .
democratic i wish it was as simple as that , but elections are never simple .
democratic we all know that it could come down to a handful of votes , and this election is the most expensive election in the entire country after bill ’ s opponent , rick scott , has already spent $ 39 million from his own personal fortune along with his right-wing allies who have together spent more than $ 75 million on television against him .
democratic that ’ s right . $ 75 million trying to drag bill down and mislead florida voters about rick scott ’ s record.bill is in the fight of his life and he needs us in the ring fighting alongside him .
democratic together , we can take back the senate and take back this country , but we need your help .
democratic you may have heard about rick scott .
democratic he ’ s the guy trying to buy this critical senate seat as trump ’ s hand-picked candidate and righthand man .
democratic or you could remember him from when he led the charge against the affordable care act before he ran for office .
democratic or you may know him as denying the science behind climate change .
democratic but you better believe it , and you better believe that we can ’ t afford to let him take a single vote in the senate or represent the people of florida any longer .
democratic there you have it , folks .
democratic this is the whole ballgame and with your help we can hit this one out of the park . – joe this email was sent to politicalemaildatabase @ gmail.com.

democratic contribute now and help debbie stand up to donald trump and john james .
democratic if you haven ’ t been to john james ’ facebook page , we don ’ t blame you .
democratic he rarely talks about michigan .
democratic mostly , he posts lots of pictures of himself with donald trump , mike pence or any other distant relative of the trump family .
democratic last week james even shared live video from his rally with don jr. and ted nugent .
democratic the rally was a disturbing preview of our future if john james wins .
democratic michigan didn ’ t come up much in the hours long rally .
democratic instead , promises that james would be loyal to donald trump did .
democratic over and over and over ...
democratic we don ’ t have to tell you what a disaster it will be for michigan if john james wins and donald trump gets his rubber stamp .
democratic let ’ s make sure we ’ re doing everything we can to stop them while we still have time .

democratic if we are going to put a real check in place against donald trump ’ s recklessness , we need to not only win seats but hold every single seat we currently have .
democratic and right now , senator menendez is up against a trump loyalist and self-funder who made his fortune price-gouging cancer patients on the cost of life-saving medication .
democratic we cannot allow our opponent to use his money to buy this seat and prevent us from putting a stop to donald trump.help us win this race on november 6th by committing a little time this weekend to join our field team in talking with voters .

democratic mitch mcconnell knows exactly what he wants to do if republicans keep the senate .
democratic he ’ s flat-out admitted that he wants to cut social security , cut medicare , and repeal the affordable care act .
democratic and we know exactly how to stop him.democrats need to win back the senate .
democratic and i ’ ll just be blunt : we won ’ t win the senate if my friends senators sherrod brown and tammy baldwin lose their re-election campaigns in ohio and wisconsin.will you help make sure democrats can take back the senate – and fight for our seniors and our health care ?
democratic chip in $ 3 , or whatever you can afford , to help re-elect sherrod and tammy .
democratic donald trump won both of their states in 2016 .
democratic so he ’ s going all out to take them down in november .
democratic you know what that means : big rallies , nasty tweets , and getting his right-wing billionaire buddies to dump tons of dark money into attack ads .
democratic that just means we have to fight back even harder .
democratic we can ’ t let mitch mcconnell get away with his scheme .
democratic we can ’ t let him rip health care away from tens of millions of americans – and pay for tax breaks for the wealthy and well-connected by cutting social security and medicare .
democratic it ’ s the classic republican two-step – a tale as old as time .
democratic first , they give huge tax breaks to billionaires and giant corporations while playing dumb about the deficit .
democratic tax breaks for the wealthy will pay for themselves ! ”
democratic as if they were sprinkling fairy dust on the yacht economy , or planting magic beans on wall street . )
democratic second , after their fairy tale doesn ’ t come true and – surprise , surprise – they ’ ve blown up the deficit , they say , “ oh my goodness , we now realize that the deficit exists !
democratic it ’ s time to pay for those tax breaks by cutting social security and medicare . ”
democratic and we ’ re not falling for it .
democratic we saw what happened after the republicans rammed through their tax bill .
democratic giant corporations – and the wealthiest of the wealthy – made out like bandits .
democratic corporate profits got juiced .
democratic but on the whole , workers ’ wages stayed flat .
democratic we can expect more of the same if we let republicans keep control of congress after november .
democratic washington will continue to work great for the wealthy and well-connected , but working people will continue to get kicked in the teeth.we need leaders in congress like sherrod brown and tammy baldwin – who ’ ll fight for social security , medicare , and everyone ’ s right to health care .

democratic cardin has hel d public office since 1967 , when lyndon b .
democratic johnson was president , is being used against him , predictably , in his campaign for a third term in the u.s.
democratic unfortunately for his rivals , none of them particularly qualified for high elective office , longevity has dimmed neither his energy nor his a bilities .
democratic maryland ’ s senior senator remains , as he has been for decad es , a conscientious , substantive and ethical public servant .
democratic he deserves re election.mr.
democratic cardin , who served 40 years as a state lawmaker and th en in the house of representatives before being elected to the senate in 20 06 , is a resolute democrat ; he has been equally resolute in seizing opportu nities at bipartisanship .
democratic in the senate , he has joined forces with republic ans to advance legislation to assist retirement savers ; impose sanctions on russia for human rights abuses ; and , most recently , promote a healthy ches apeake bay .
democratic detail-oriented , no-nonsense and far less prone to grandstandin g than most of his senate colleagues , mr .
democratic cardin works well across the aisl e because he is what he appears to be : deeply committed to the hard work of legislation and oversight based on the values he cherishes.those v alues are animated by , among other things , mr .
democratic cardin ’ s abiding commi tment to human rights at home and abroad .
democratic he has served as a co-chairman of the u.s.
democratic helsinki commission , which promotes democracy in former soviet bl oc countries , and remains a commissioner of that organization .
democratic jo hn mccain ( r-ariz . ) , mr .
democratic cardin led a drive to punish russian officials inv olved in the death of a russian lawyer who had exposed high-ranking governm ent corruption .
democratic he is now pushing to use that same legislation to hold saudi arabia ’ s royal family to account for the death of journal ist and post contributor jamal khashoggi .
democratic few sitting senators have been as effective in advancing the cause of aligning american values and policies in the conduct of u.s. foreign policy.at the same time , he has tend ed to shy away from knee-jerk partisanship and sloganeering , declining , for instance , to call for disbanding immigration and customs enforcement , the agency whose deportation zeal and excesses , as mr .
democratic cardin understood , are exercised at the trump administration ’ s behest.that has l eft his opponents scrambling for traction and unable to make a compelling c ase for their candidacies in the current race .
democratic they include a republican , xa0 ; tony campbell , a lecturer at towson university who has sought to blame mr .
democratic cardin for problems in baltimore ’ s school system — notwiths tanding that public schools are mainly a local and state responsibility , no t a federal one .
democratic an independent candidate , neal simon , a financial services executive , seeks to capitalize on mr .
democratic cardin ’ s long service by saying he is “ part of the problem ” in washington.i n fact , it strains credulity to think mr .
democratic simon would accom plish nearly as much in the senate , given their inexperience .
democratic cardin — deeply knowledgeable , thoughtful and effective — i s a credit to maryland .
democratic friends – early voting in many florida counties starts tomorrow , but we &apos;re not even close to raising the $ 100,000 we need by midnight .
democratic we can &apos;t afford to fall short .
democratic our race in florida will decide control of the senate , and these fundraising goals and deadlines have real meaning – we &apos;re making real-time decisions every day based on hitting these goals , and falling short today means scaling back our operations or pulling down our ads tomorrow .

democratic and with just hours to go before our critical midnight deadline , we need another $ 30,000 to close the gap .

democratic 20 here &apos;s a preview into one of the first decisions that pennsylvania &apos;s next senator will need to make : mitch mcconnell and the trump administration have made it clear that , after this election , they &apos;re putting massive cuts to programs like medicare , medicaid and social security on the table .
democratic they need to pay for the corporate tax cut they passed last year , and they want to send the bill directly to working families and seniors .
democratic if i &apos;m re-elected , i &apos;ll fight that plan with everything i &apos;ve got .
democratic but if i lose , i don &apos;t trust lou barletta to take up that fight .
democratic he voted for these tax cuts , knowing they would have to be paid for eventually .
democratic he &apos;s supported plans to end medicare as we know it .
democratic he votes with the president 99 % of the time .
democratic he looks out for far-right special interests , not pennsylvania families.i need your help to win re-election so that i can fight this dangerous agenda , which would hurt so many people here at home .
democratic congressman barletta caught up to me in fundraising last quarter , and if we don &apos;t act fast , he might outraise us before election day .
democratic there are only 17 days left in this campaign , so we can &apos;t fall behind .
democratic please , if you can , make a donation to support my campaign .

democratic friend , a few weeks ago , a poll came out showing that i had a lead in this senate race .
democratic a week later , another poll showed my opponent in the lead.so when i tell you that this race is a true toss-up and what you do will make a difference -- i ’ m not kidding around .
democratic the truth is , we could fall behind very quickly .
democratic republicans always have the resources for last-minute ad buys and gotv campaigns .
democratic just in the last week , both the nra and president trump ’ s super pac announced they were each spending seven figures to buy even more ads .
democratic we don ’ t have resources like they do .
democratic instead , we ’ ve got to rely on our grassroots supporters .
democratic i know i ’ ve already asked a lot of you , friend .

democratic 20 graham , new jersey voters deserve to have a candidate they can trust .
democratic 20 that isn &apos;t a radical new idea by any means -- but unfortunately , bob hugin has proven time and again that the people of new jersey can &apos;t trust him .
democratic 20 his campaign has been spreading blatant lies about our team and senator menendez .
democratic and he is using his dirty money from price-gouging cancer patients to keep spreading those lies .
democratic 20 if hugin is willing to lie to you during the campaign , there is no doubt he will lie to you on the debate stage and in congress .
democratic but tomorrow night , the lies stop .
democratic 20 tune into njtv news tomorrow night at 8 pm to watch the new jersey u.s.
democratic 20 while senator menendez is stopping hugin &apos;s lies up on the debate stage , will you chip in $ 5 or more and help us stop hugin &apos;s lies on the streets ?
democratic donate our staff thought it might be fun to ask our supporters to donate $ 1 per hugin lie , but we quickly realized that based on how hugin has run his campaign , that might run up the tab quickly .
democratic 20 so instead , while you watch the debate at home , make sure to live-tweet and call out hugin every time he lies with the hashtag # anotherhuginlie .
democratic 20 your support will help senator menendez fight off these lies and ensure that we come out on top november 6th .

democratic 20 graham , one of the most blatant lies that bob hugin told during wednesday &apos;s njtv senate debate was his laughable attempt to re-brand himself as a pro-choice republican .
democratic hugin has spent years donating thousands of dollars to anti-choice candidates .
democratic he has been vocally supportive of anti-choice justices like brett kavanaugh , who has a well-documented history of opposing roe v.
democratic and when pressed on it by reporters , hugin couldn &apos;t even muster a coherent response .
democratic 20 ch eck out this video and then help us elect a real leader who has always been on new jersey women &apos;s side , bob menendez .
democratic 20 donate after running from his pro-trump record in the debate , bob hugin continued to mislead voters with his claims to be pro-choice while simultaneously supporting brett kavanaugh for the supreme court .
democratic when told that brett kavanaugh said that the historic case was incorrectly decided , hugin incoherently responded , &quot; but that doesn &apos;t mean you change the - there are a lot of laws that don &apos;t get changed but decided for the different reason - and as the ultimate - they stay valid laws , but are changed - the rationale for supporting them . &quot;
democratic which is it hugin ?
democratic 20 luckily , voters don &apos;t have to decipher bob menendez &apos;s position .
democratic he has been a vocal supporter of a woman &apos;s right to choose and has voted to protect it over and over again .
democratic but now bob menendez needs your help to win and stop hugin and his anti-choice friends from forcing their draconian beliefs on the women of new jersey .

democratic 20 well this is rich , team : it &apos;s no secret how much the president supports bob &apos;s opponent , congressman lou barletta .
democratic in fact , trump loves barletta so much that he sent an email asking pennsylvanians to donate to barletta &apos;s campaign .
democratic this email is just another example of the president &apos;s plan to turn pennsylvania red this year by electing his good friend to the senate .
democratic electing lou barletta would mean another vote toward repealing the affordable care act and passing more tax schemes that put the wealthiest 1 % ahead of working families.the president is raising piles of money for bob &apos;s opponent , and we need to make sure we keep up .
democratic can you rush $ 5 right now to help him keep up the fight ?
democratic the president loves to campaign for barletta , so much so that before he sent this fundraising email , he already held two pennsylvania rallies for him , gave barletta shoutouts at numerous official events and sent out a robocall to encourage voters to turnout for lou .
democratic in fact , a recent washington post analysis discovered trump has given more support to barletta than anyone else running for office this year.while bob &apos;s fighting for pennsylvania , republicans from president trump on down will continue to attack him .

democratic friend , i am so grateful tonight to everyone in minnesota who put their faith in me .
democratic i promise i will work hard every day on your behalf as your united states senator .
democratic but , as we ’ ve said all along , this election wasn ’ t about me , a political party , or even a president -- it ’ s about the people of minnesota .
democratic this campaign was for the mother of two with a pre-existing condition who needs health care , the grandparents on a fixed income who can ’ t afford the high cost of prescription drugs , the worker who needs to make a living wage so they can put food on the table and a roof over their head , the student struggling with the crushing load of debt , and for everyone in minnesota that needs a government that works for them -- not just those who can write big checks .
democratic tonight everyone on this team sent a message that when we work together a campaign for all of us can win -- and we can do it the right way .
democratic we knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors , made hundreds of thousands of phone calls , and raised the funds to build this campaign one small donation at a time .
democratic i can ’ t ever thank you enough for everything you did to build this campaign , and for the sacrifices you made to do it -- but if i can make one more ask before i say goodnight to you , it would be this : don ’ t stop .
democratic this victory tonight was made by your hard work , but if we let up , even for a second , we can ’ t make any of the progress we all are fighting for .
democratic it ’ s going to take this same effort from people across the country to change what happens in washington .
democratic so tonight celebrate , hug your loved ones , and ring in the night with your friends .
democratic but tomorrow , we all must get right back to work .
democratic thank you again for everything you did to make this possible .
democratic i can ’ t ever thank you enough .

democratic after rick scott and his mega-donors spent $ 80 million trying to buy this senate seat , a new poll shows us down by 1 .

democratic it &apos;s no exaggeration to say the future of our health care , our climate and our children rides on what happens here .

democratic i represent mike pence &apos;s home state , and he and trump have both been here multiple times to campaign against me .
democratic they won indiana by 19 points in 2016 , so i &apos;m fighting an uphill battle -- nearly every poll shows my race within the margin of error .
democratic my race is a must-win if democrats are going to have any chance at stopping mitch mcconnell in the senate , and with fewer than two weeks until election day every contribution -- even just $ 5 -- makes a tremendous difference.i &apos;m counting on the support of committed democrats like you .
democratic can you make a $ 10 contribution to my re-election campaign and democrats nationwide ?
democratic donate : $ 10donate : $ 25donate : $ 50donate : $ 100donate : $ 200or donate another amount .
democratic donald trump , mike pence , and mitch mcconnell would be thrilled to have another yes man for their agenda in this seat instead of someone like me who stands up and fights the hard fights for hoosiers .
democratic i have never been afraid to take a tough stand for our values -- even when it may not be easy or politically expedient .
democratic now trump , pence , and even donald trump jr. are campaigning against me to try to make me pay a high price for standing up for workers &apos; rights , lgbtq rights , and the right of every person in this country to access quality , affordable health care .
democratic mcconnell and his gop mega-donor machine are coming after me this cycle , and frankly , it &apos;s been tough to keep up with their smear campaigns .
democratic that &apos;s why i am counting on the support of grassroots supporters like you to help me fight back and defend this seat .
democratic that &apos;s why i &apos;m asking you : will you make a $ 10 donation to my re-election campaign and to democrats in all 50 states ?
democratic we simply can &apos;t afford to lose any ground in the senate .
democratic thank you for all that you do , joe joe donnelly u.s.

democratic even worse , rick scott has given his campaign $ 12.5 million in the past 11 days alone to try to buy this race.and now the latest poll shows we &apos;ve lost our lead : we &apos;re now tied in the race that politico says will decide control of the senate .
democratic the only way to stop scott and the gop from flipping this senate seat is if we hit our critical $ 150,000 goal to make up this shortfall .
democratic and with senate control on the line , a generous group of donors just stepped up to triple every dollar we receive before midnight to protect florida &apos;s senate seat.this is the last triple match of this campaign .
democratic but with just a few hours left , we &apos;re still falling short : rush $ 5 immediately – before this final triple match expires at midnight – and have your gift tripled to defend florida &apos;s senate seat and take back the senate for democrats !
democratic if you &apos;ve saved payment information with actblue express , your donation will go through immediately : donate $ 5 ( becomes $ 15 ) donate $ 25 ( becomes $ 75 ) donate $ 50 ( becomes $ 150 ) other amount thank you so much , bendigital director this email was sent to politicalemaildatabase @ gmail.com.

democratic trump on florida &apos;s senate race : &quot; i can say with all certainty that if bill nelson ... loses this race , they have no chance at taking back the senate .
democratic this is a huge opportunity for florida to decide the fate of our nation . &quot;
democratic he &apos;s right , friends : senate control is riding on this race .
democratic that &apos;s why trump just got off stage in florida after campaigning again for his hand-picked candidate , extremist rick scott .
democratic and that &apos;s why , with the polls opening in just three days , i need your help .
democratic a recent survey has us down by 1 , so a group of donors is tripling all gifts today , up to our $ 125,000 goal , to take back the senate – but we &apos;re falling way short.with only three hours left before our triple match expires , i &apos;m counting on grassroots supporters like you to donate right now ( every $ 1 becomes $ 3 ) to stop trump , win in florida and take back the senate .
democratic this is the last triple match of our campaign : rush $ 5 and have it go three times as far , for the very last time , to stop trump and scott , defend florida &apos;s senate seat and take back the senate for democrats !
democratic if you &apos;ve saved payment information with actblue express , your donation will go through immediately : donate $ 5 ( becomes $ 15 ) donate $ 25 ( becomes $ 75 ) donate $ 50 ( becomes $ 150 ) other amount thank you , bill this email was sent to politicalemaildatabase @ gmail.com.

democratic barletta loves to attack bob &apos;s record of fighting for pennsylvania families , but we know the truth .

democratic bad news , friend — we &apos;re just 16 days out from election day , and here &apos;s the latest : nate silver &apos;s fivethirtyeight says claire &apos;s race is in a dead heat with gop extremist josh hawley , and the washington post says this is one of the most competitive races in the country .
democratic far-right extremists like mitch mcconnell and the koch brothers &apos; network have dumped over $ 20 million into missouri to try to flip this seat red .
democratic we need to raise $ 75,000 by midnight tomorrow , and right now we &apos;re falling way behind .
democratic that &apos;s why a generous group of donors has offered to match every contribution before midnight tomorrow to help us meet this crucial goal and re-elect claire !
democratic so friend , we urgently need you to give whatever you can right now .
democratic with election day this close , every cent counts .
democratic rush $ 5 right now — don &apos;t waste another second — and have your gift doubled to defend missouri &apos;s democratic senate seat !

democratic friends – we &apos;re in the final stretch of this campaign .
democratic nate silver &apos;s fivethirtyeight just named me the most vulnerable democratic senator in the entire country.that &apos;s why rick scott and his right-wing allies have already spent more than $ 80 million to try to defeat me – because they know that if we lose in florida , democrats cannot take back the senate !
democratic and their money has made this race neck and neck – the closest in the country , so they aren &apos;t slowing down .
democratic with ballots already being cast in florida , we &apos;re running out of time .
democratic but right now , our fundraising is falling short .
democratic we need to raise $ 100,000 before our pivotal midnight deadline to protect florida &apos;s senate seat and take back the senate – and we can &apos;t do it without you .
democratic i &apos;m counting on you to give right now : give $ 5 or more now – whatever you can before our midnight deadline – to protect florida &apos;s senate seat and take back the senate for democrats !

democratic just $ 5 goes a long way toward putting our final ads on the air , organizing supporters and getting out the vote .
democratic we cannot slow down now .
democratic not when the trump administration decided to pass a massive tax break for the wealthiest 1 % , not when senate republicans are coming after protections for people with pre-existing conditions and not when far-right special interests sold out the middle class .
democratic to really put a stop to the gop &apos;s almost unchecked power , we need to elect a democratic senate majority , and we can &apos;t do that if i lose .
democratic if republicans hold on to the majority , they &apos;ll continue their assault on protections for people with pre-existing conditions , continue to pass tax laws that make it harder for families to get ahead and even follow through on their threats to decimate medicaid and medicare .
democratic we can &apos;t let that happen.i &apos;ve been a firewall against the trump administration &apos;s most dangerous and divisive pieces of legislation , but i can &apos;t keep fighting without your help .

democratic friend , this week we learned mitch mcconnell and his mega-donor friends are spending more in arizona ’ s toss-up senate race than any other group .
democratic the details are incredible : mcconnell uses “ mystery money ” from sham corporations “ whose true identities remained shrouded . ”
democratic the arizona republic wrote , “ mcsally &apos;s campaign depends on mcconnell &apos;s efforts . ”
democratic she ’ s relying on mcconnell ’ s millions to spread lies and dirty smears about kyrsten .
democratic mcconnell is pumping millions of dollars from mega-donors into this race to try and counter the power of kyrsten ’ s grassroots support .
democratic team , mcconnell thinks he can win this race with his “ mystery money . ”
democratic let ’ s prove him wrong.ch ip in today to stand up to mitch mcconnell and help kyrsten win arizona ’ s toss-up senate race .
democratic donate $ 10 thanks for standing with us , team sinema 09 paid for by sinema for arizona kyrsten is running for the united states senate because she wants to help arizonans get their shot at the american dream .

democratic once in a while , republicans say what they really think .
democratic they know that their agenda – twisting government so it only works for the rich and powerful – is deeply unpopular .
democratic so they usually tip-toe and sweet-talk around it , make pretty promises and blatant lies , and hope that nobody will figure out what they ’ re really up to .
democratic but last week , mitch mcconnell gave the game away.if republicans keep control of congress , they want to pay for their tax breaks for billionaires and giant corporations by cutting social security , medicare , and medicaid .
democratic they want to repeal the affordable care act and rip health care away from tens of millions of americans .
democratic you know what that means : the stakes of this election have never been more clear .
democratic after republicans won the white house in 2016 , they passed $ 1.5 trillion in tax breaks for the wealthiest americans and the biggest corporations .
democratic they swore up and down that it would pay for itself .
democratic of course , it didn ’ t .
democratic it made the deficit skyrocket .
democratic and this is their favorite scam .
democratic all along , republicans were itching to cut social security , medicare , medicaid , and the affordable care act .
democratic now that the deficit is through the roof , they ’ re trying to make it seem like we don ’ t have a choice .
democratic but of course we do .
democratic of course we can stick to our values and keep our promises .
democratic republicans bury their heads in the sand and insist that the “ real ” cause of deficits and debt is programs that help working people .
democratic that ’ s why mitch mcconnell said he wants to cut social security , medicare , and medicaid .
democratic let ’ s take those one at a time .
democratic the gop loves to use scare tactics to claim that social security is on the brink of running out of money – that we need to cut benefits or privatize it and put retirement in the hands of wall street .
democratic but that ’ s just not true .
democratic with some modest adjustments , it ’ s possible to keep the system funded for decades more , even while increasing benefits .
democratic this isn &apos;t just an argument about math , though .
democratic this is about our values .
democratic after a lifetime of hard work , people deserve to retire with dignity – and that means protecting and expanding social security .
democratic because let ’ s face it : even though social security keeps 22 million americans out of poverty , it ’ s not much to live on .
democratic on average , social security checks come out to less than $ 1,450 a month .
democratic and more than half of seniors rely on those checks for most of their retirement income.the absolute last thing we should do – at the very moment that social security has become so essential to millions of our seniors – is to allow the program to be dismantled inch by inch .
democratic and we can ’ t let the republicans get their hands on medicare , either .
democratic ever since the infamous “ ryan budget , ” paul ryan ’ s pet scheme has been to replace medicare with a voucher program – one of the worst zombie ideas in washington that just refuses to die .
democratic it wouldn ’ t do anything to reduce the cost of health care .
democratic it would just make seniors carry the burden of skyrocketing health care costs .
democratic instead of slashing medicare benefits and increasing prices for seniors so politicians who hate government can feel better about themselves , we should focus on solving the actual problem – lowering the cost of health care .
democratic for example : it ’ s ridiculous that washington and drug companies cut a deal to prevent medicare from using its bargaining power to negotiate for lower prices on prescriptions .
democratic and it ’ s ridiculous that washington won ’ t let americans import cheaper prescription drugs from canada .
democratic that doesn ’ t help seniors , and it doesn ’ t help taxpayers .
democratic it ’ s just a giveaway to big drug companies .
democratic but that ’ s who republicans work for .
democratic and let ’ s talk about medicaid , too – because paul ryan has been dreaming about cutting medicaid since college .
democratic tens of millions of americans count on medicaid for quality , affordable health coverage .
democratic it helps make sure they can make ends meet and go to the doctor when they ’ re sick .
democratic it helps make sure that people with disabilities and other long-term care needs can live independently and be part of their communities .
democratic medicaid is there when a little baby is born too soon with serious medical needs , a grandparent requires nursing home care , or a mom needs to make sure her kids can see a doctor .
democratic americans know that medicaid matters .
democratic that ’ s why – when republicans tried and failed to gut medicaid and repeal the affordable care act – cancer survivors and people with disabilities flooded the capitol to make their voices heard .
democratic mamas wheeled in their children with feeding tubes and oxygen tanks .
democratic they made it clear that they need medicaid to be able to live their lives .
democratic and they helped make sure that we saved health care for tens of millions of americans .
democratic i remember standing on my tiptoes on the senate floor , hanging onto ted kennedy ’ s desk , and watching senator john mccain cast the deciding vote .
democratic mitch mcconnell recently called that “ the one disappointment of this congress . ”
democratic but he ’ s not afraid to try again – if they keep control of the senate on november 6th .
democratic &quot; … if we had the votes to completely start over , we ’ d do it .
democratic but that depends on what happens in a couple weeks . ”
democratic that ’ s right – health care for tens millions of americans does depend on what happens in 13 days .
democratic so does social security .
democratic because the midterm elections are about one fundamental question : who does government work for ?
democratic if republicans get their way , they ’ ll make washington work like a dream come true for the wealthy and well-connected .
democratic but if we fight our hearts out for the next 13 days and put democrats back in power , we can fight for a government that works for everyone , not just people who can afford to hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers .
democratic we can fight back against the corruption that ’ s hollowing out america ’ s middle class and tearing down our democracy .
democratic the republican congress doesn ’ t work for working families .
democratic it works for corporate lobbyists and campaign donors – who get big tax breaks and open up their checkbooks to fill republican campaign war chests .
democratic the other side has money and power – but we have our voices and our votes .
democratic there are a lot more of us than there are of them .
democratic and in a democracy , that matters .
democratic in the next 13 days , we need to fight harder than ever to protect social security , medicare , medicaid , and health care for tens of millions of americans.you can sleep after election day .
democratic until then , use every minute you can spare to make sure that everyone you know is ready to vote .
democratic make sure that democrats win up and down the ballot .
democratic be in this fight all the way – and i ’ ll be right there by your side .
democratic thanks for being a part of this , elizabeth elizabeth warren is running for reelection in 2018 , and we &apos;re trying to build the strongest grassroots team in history .
democratic will you chip in for the first time and join us ?

democratic rally in greenfield help joe fight back !
democratic friend , the week that extreme republican rep .
democratic mike braun bought the republican primary , president trump and vp pence immediately jetted to indiana to campaign for him : the president personally attacked joe vp pence charged up to $ 25,000 per person at a pricey indianapolis fundraiser and rep .
democratic braun promised to serve as a “ true reinforcement ” for president trump now , with less than 3 weeks to go until the election , donald trump , jr. is coming back for more .
democratic we need to make it clear that hoosiers don ’ t want a “ reinforcement ” for the president ( or his son ! ) -- they want a senator who ’ s a reinforcement for hard-working hoosiers , and who ’ ll stand up to him and his far-right allies when they ’ re doing things that are bad for indiana.but we can ’ t win this without your help , team .

democratic i have good news to report , friends .
democratic polls here in florida over the summer showed us tied or down .
democratic now , after more than 1 million floridians have cast their ballots , polls consistently have us with narrow leads in the most expensive race in the country !
democratic i know how we got to this point , friends .
democratic we got here because of you .
democratic grassroots support has so far been able to push back against the $ 80 million that rick scott and his allies have spent against me on tv .
democratic this is good news , but rick scott has noticed our lead .
democratic he just gave himself $ 23.3 million , on top of the $ 38 million he gave prior to october .
democratic he &apos;s using that money to air misleading and false attack ads .
democratic we know those same ads had an effect on the race during the summer , and it could have one now too.losing florida would cost democrats the senate , so we can &apos;t allow republicans to retake the lead – that &apos;s why we have to raise $ 250,000 by the end of this week.we need to hit this goal in order to keep the lead - and i need you to give now to protect florida &apos;s senate seat and take back the senate for democrats .

democratic give now to retake the lead and take back the senate for democrats .
democratic after a new poll came out showing bill nelson trailing by 1 , nate silver &apos;s fivethirtyeight downgraded our chances of winning in florida .

democratic tomorrow so heidi can keep her ads on the air .
democratic w e cannot afford to come up short with election day 17 days away .

democratic friend , i ’ ll be up front with you : i ’ m asking you to make a donation of whatever amount you can to help us reach our final end-of-month goal .
democratic now let me tell you why .
democratic this is one of the closest races in the country .
democratic the latest polls show a dead heat .
democratic my opponent ’ s campaign has spent $ 11 million .
democratic mitch mcconnell ’ s super pac dumped in $ 11 million more .
democratic our campaign isn ’ t about super pacs and dark money -- we ’ re relying on grassroots support to win .
democratic and that ’ s why the other side ’ s money doesn ’ t scare me.but if we ’ re going to take this race from a tie to a win , we have to be able to fight back against all those millions -- and with the triple match in effect , i know we can do it .
democratic friend , will you make a donation before wednesday ’ s deadline to help us beat rep .

democratic express donate $ 25 ( becomes $ 100 with triple-match ! )
democratic express donate $ 50 ( becomes $ 200 with triple-match ! )
democratic or , donate a different amount my opponent seems to believe that if he wins in ten days , his job will be to serve as a copy machine for president trump .
democratic and too bad for any hoosier who disagrees !
democratic but that ’ s not how i see the job .
democratic as indiana ’ s hired help in the senate , my job is to think through the issues and do what ’ s right for hoosiers -- which is why i ’ m going to keep fighting to protect our health care and put a stop to the worst parts of the president ’ s agenda.but that only happens if i make it back to the senate .
democratic and there ’ s not much time left for you to make a final impact in this toss-up race .
democratic so friend , will you rush a donation now to help us reach our $ 75,000 goal ?
democratic with the triple match active , your gift will go four times as far .
democratic thank you , joe donate !

democratic friends – trump was just in florida for the second time this week campaigning for his handpicked candidate , rick scott .
democratic trump knows how high the stakes are , saying that if we lose , democrats &quot; have no chance at taking back the senate . &quot;
democratic election day is tomorrow , but our fundraising has slowed down – and that needs to change quickly .
democratic every single dollar we raise today will go toward our turnout operation tomorrow .
democratic so if we don &apos;t bounce back today , rick scott will win tomorrow – and trump will keep senate control .
democratic we &apos;re making our final budget decisions tonight , and with the latest poll showing us tied , we need to get $ 75,000 in the door today if we want to avoid cutting back – but we &apos;re still short .
democratic senate control is on the line , so your gift right now could be the difference between a democratic and a republican senate : please , rush $ 5 immediately to help fight back against trump and scott , defend florida &apos;s senate seat and take back the senate for democrats .

democratic this news could sink our campaign , team : mitch mcconnell just dumped another $ 2 million into new attack ads to defeat us in nevada and keep his grip on the senate majority .
democratic that &apos;s why i &apos;m about to walk into an emergency finance meeting with my team – we &apos;re making final decisions about the last 10 days of this campaign , and the reality is , pulling back anywhere right now could ruin our chance to take back the senate for democrats .
democratic this moment couldn &apos;t be more important : nevadans are already voting , early-voter turnout is high and we have a clear path to senate control .
democratic but right now , the gop is going all-in to defeat us , and we &apos;re running out of money to fund our ads and keep turnout high in the last 10 days of this race .
democratic senate control and the future of the supreme court are on the line , and the polls show us within 1 point .
democratic a group of donors is matching all gifts up to our $ 200,000 goal to win in nevada , but time is running out and you &apos;re our only hope : please , will you rush every dollar you can – and have it doubled – to fight back against the gop , win in nevada and take back the senate for democrats ?

democratic this victory was not a given , not by a long shot .

democratic it would have been easier to give up .
democratic but that &apos;s not the america that you or i believe in .
democratic those aren &apos;t the values we stand for .
democratic that &apos;s not the party we belong to .
democratic instead , we fought for every single vote , in every single state .
democratic we invested over $ 30 million directly into state parties and campaigns , rebuilt our ground game by hiring organizers across the country , and talked to each and every voter about what we believe this country can be .
democratic it paid off : we didn &apos;t just take back the house -- we elected a historic slate of women , people of color , veterans , and members of the lgbtq community .
democratic these leaders have changed the face of our party , and now they will change the face of our government .
democratic that &apos;s progress in the truest sense of the word .

democratic but i want to share one headline this week that should remind all of us of the gravity of what we ’ re fighting for here -- and what happens if we lose that fight .
democratic if we lose even one senate seat this november , that could mean the repeal of the affordable care act .
democratic loss of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions .
democratic and deep cuts to programs our communities rely on like social security and medicare .
democratic i ’ m going to give it everything i have over these 19 days to win this senate seat and make sure mitch mcconnell and trump can ’ t enact one more part of their extreme agenda -- but i need your help .

democratic friends – our 24-hour match opportunity expires in less than four hours , and we &apos;re falling way short of what we need .
democratic senate control hinges on our florida senate race – and nate silver &apos;s fivethirtyeight just moved our race from &quot; lean democrat &quot; to &quot; toss-up &quot; after a brand-new poll showed us down by 1 point .
democratic that &apos;s why donors are doubling all gifts up to $ 150,000 .
democratic we need every dollar of it , but the offer only lasts until midnight .
democratic in a race this close , your gift could decide senate control – and you &apos;re running out of time to have it doubled .
democratic if we miss our midnight deadline , we will lose this race , and democrats will lose our only chance to take back the senate .
democratic so with just hours to go , i &apos;m counting on you to give now before this huge match offer expires : please rush $ 5 more now – before midnight tonight – and have it doubled so we can pull ahead in the polls , protect florida &apos;s senate seat and take back the senate for democrats .

democratic “ mcconnell eyes cuts to medicare , social security to address deficit ” -- msnbc outrageous !
democratic help joe stop his shameful agenda friend -- this is un. be. lieveable .
democratic in 2017 , mitch mcconnell rammed through an appalling law that slashed taxes for the ultra-wealthy while raising health care costs for the middle class .
democratic he claimed it would pay for itself .
democratic joe voted against it .
democratic mcconnell ’ s tax scam is ballooning the nation ’ s deficit -- and now he wants to cut programs like social security and medicare to pay for it !
democratic he actually said that “ medicare , social security , and medicaid ” funding constitutes “ the real driver of the debt . ”
democratic earth to mitch : have you forgotten about the bills racked up by your 2.2-trillion-dollar tax law ?
democratic but it gets even worse .
democratic because if mcconnell is successful in replacing joe with a copy machine for his far-right agenda -- and his allies are spending millions to do just that -- he ’ ll be one step closer to destroying the programs so many americans have paid into .
democratic friend , we have to stop him .
democratic and we can do it by defeating his chosen candidate and sending joe back to the senate to fight mcconnell ’ s plans tooth and nail .
democratic but you have to act before it ’ s too late !
democratic will you chip in to help joe stop the mcconnell agenda ? -- team donnelly donate paid for by donnelly for indiana p.o.

democratic i need your help , friends – i was in florida over the weekend trying to stop governor rick scott from buying a senate seat in just five days .
democratic scott is a self-funding millionaire and one of president trump ’ s closest allies – if he wins , he ’ ll be a rubber stamp for the gop ’ s agenda .
democratic his opponent , senator bill nelson , is a friend of mine .

democratic he always does what he thinks is right for the people of florida , especially when it comes to fighting republican attempts to take away people ’ s health care .
democratic here ’ s the problem : this is a “ toss-up ” race and scott has already spent $ 65 million of his personal wealth attacking bill nelson .
democratic he ’ s poised to spend more in the final week of this election , and we need to help ensure bill ’ s re-election campaign has the resources to fight back : your contribution of $ 5 or more could be the difference between victory or defeat for senator bill nelson .
democratic add yours today : if you &apos;ve saved payment information with actblue express , your donation will go through immediately : donate $ 5 donate $ 25 donate $ 50 other amount this is one of those races that could make or break the 2018 elections for democrats .
democratic if we can hold off this challenge from one of donald trump ’ s closest allies , it will send a powerful message to this white house and help us replace mitch mcconnell as senate majority leader .
