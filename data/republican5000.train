republican friend , there &apos;s something much scarier than halloween – my opponent &apos;s leftist track record .
republican stop sinema before she was &quot; the most liberal legislator in the state of arizona , &quot; she was a radical activist and protestor .
republican days after 9 / 11 , she dressed up in a tutu and protested our troops ...
republican at another protest she organized , sinema passed out flyers like this depicting u.s. troops as skeletons and saying they were &quot; us terror &quot; : sinema &apos;s radical past is still very much alive but she and her liberal super pac &apos;s are spending millions to try and hide that and pull a fast one on arizonan &apos;s .
republican and friend , my opponent &apos;s extreme positions are scary ... on everything from stay home mothers ( who she called &quot; leeches &quot; ) to the state she represents ( which she referred to as a &quot; meth lab of democracy &quot; and said the people are &quot; crazy &quot; . )
republican i need your help to keep arizona represented in the us senate by someone who is proud to call it home .
republican right now , sinema and myself are in a dead heat and currently tied .
republican we need the funds to execute our plan to pull ahead .
republican if you find her extremism as frightening as i do , help me stop her before it &apos;s too late .
republican time is running out ... we cannot afford to lose .

republican graham , with 5 days to go until election day , we &apos;re on the verge of pulling off one of the great upsets in virginia history !
republican this is a race we can win !
republican because great friends like you joined our conservative movement , we &apos;re closing fast on professional politician , senator tim kaine , and we &apos;re within striking distance of victory .
republican a recent poll has us down by a slim 50 % to 45 % margin , within the poll &apos;s margin of error .
republican that &apos;s why i am counting on my best supporters like you , graham , to rush a campaign contribution of $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 75 , $ 100 or even more .
republican commonwealth voters want to take back virginia , fire tim kaine , drain the swamp , cut big government down to size and more than anything else , citizens here want change .
republican they are desperately looking for change and tim kaine offers them more of the same .
republican he &apos;s been too liberal , too weak , too partisan , and too ineffective for too long .
republican masquerading as a moderate , he draws his support from the clintons and their far-left benefactors .
republican he &apos;s against building the wall .
republican he &apos;s against guns and our right to keep and bear arms .
republican he &apos;s against judges who are devoted to our constitution and most of all ...
republican he &apos;s against president donald trump .
republican the fact is , he hates him .
republican when he &apos;s not staking out the far-left stand , he &apos;s flipping and flopping on the issues virginians care about most .
republican he &apos;s done it on the offshore drilling that will make our country energy independent .
republican he &apos;s done it on abortion where he &apos;s against our culture of life .
republican in the closing days of a race that &apos;s too close to call , i need your emergency help to defeat washingtonian tim kaine .
republican please rush a contribution of $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 75 , $ 100 or even more in our hour of need .

republican the green party candidate in this race just dropped out and endorsed kyrsten sinema because they share the same far-left positions .
republican i &apos;m not surprised my opponent earned an endorsement from the green party , given she used to be a card-carrying member herself .
republican this is just more proof that kyrsten &apos;s moderate act is a total sham .
republican there &apos;s nothing moderate about the green party , and there &apos;s nothing moderate about my opponent .
republican please pitch in today so i can reach every last voter with the truth about my opponent &apos;s confirmed extremism before it &apos;s too late .

republican friend , that makes the left has made a total of $ 1.2 million to defeat karin and team housley in the final 6 days of this race .
republican this news is scary but it tells us one important thing ... ... the democrats and liberal left are scared .

republican dear friend , after caving to voter and media cr iticism , kirsten gillibrand has finally agreed to debate me .
republican it &apos; s a half-hour one-on-one scheduled for thursday afternoon , october 25 and won &apos;t be broadcast upstate .
republican is this what government-transparency advoca te gillibrand means when she says &quot; open public debate is essential to democ racy &quot; or is she being hypocritical yet again ?
republican i ’ m not running for senate to build a political career .
republican i ’ m r unning to fight for new york .
republican here &apos;s the bottom line : i signed up to debate senator gillibrand five times .
republican she agreed to one , then backed out .
republican i t wasn &apos;t until the new york post put her in a chicken suit on the cover that she folded and agreed to our october 25 debate . ﻿
republican but upstate residents need to hear f rom senator gillibrand , too .
republican watch my recent appearance on &quot; fox and friends first &quot; when i challenged kirsten gillibrand t o another debate on fox news so a statewide audie nce would have the opportunity to hear both sides .
republican i refuse to disenfranchise millions of upstate new yorkers just so presidential wannabe kirsten gillibrand can duc k more questions about her record and hide in new york city .
republican our next debate is scheduled for november 1 .
republican will gillibrand show up , or will she co ntinue to run for president in places like new hampshire , where she was see n campaigning this month instead of representing you ?
republican we already press ured gillibrand into sitting down for one debate .
republican now i need team chele mem bers upstate , downstate and in between to help us turn up the heat on chicken kirsten today .

republican friend , as you read this , a caravan of thousands of illegal immigrants is barreling towards our southern border , for the second time this year .
republican this situation is democrats &apos; fault .
republican newt gingrich nailed it when he called them &quot; completely loony , &quot; because they are .
republican the left continues to push their pro-amnesty , open borders agenda at the expense of americans and the only way we &apos;re going to put a stop to their extremism is by defeating them at the polls .
republican contribute i &apos;ve spent my career defending this country and i will not bow down to the democrats who want to tear down our borders and replace our security with amnesty .
republican president trump is fighting to protect our borders , but he needs more conservative allies , like me , to defeat the democrats who continue to defy the rule of law and threaten our security .
republican help me fight and win today , before the next caravan of illegal immigrants barrels towards our borders .
republican in service , martha mcsally ----------- forwarded message ----------- friend , the left &apos;s extremism has reached a tipping point , and we &apos;ve only got one shot to put a stop to it this november .
republican they think this election is their chance to retake the senate majority and inflict their completely looney policies on americans .
republican that &apos;s why it is critical that we support conservative senate candidates who are capable of defeating them at the polls — candidates like martha mcsally .
republican contribute martha mcsally is running for senate in arizona , and her tough stance on immigration has made her the democrats &apos; no . 1 target this cycle .
republican for the last two years , democrats have been preparing for this election , all the while , moving further to the left in favor of radical policies such as open borders , sanctuary cities , and the abolition of ice.sounds extreme , right ?
republican welcome to the ( new democratic ) party.leaders like martha are the key to ensuring democrats &apos; increasingly radical policies are not forced on the voters who reject them .
republican unfortunately , martha &apos;s leadership — both as a colonel in the air force and as a member of congress — has caught the left &apos;s attention , and now they want her gone .
republican contribute democrats know martha &apos;s not one to back down from a fight , especially when it comes to our nation &apos;s safety and security .
republican she &apos;s spent decades fighting for us abroad and at home , and now she needs us to stand with her so she can take our fight to the senate.so please , join me in supporting martha mcsally for senate and together we will put an end to the left &apos;s totally unacceptable , completely loony extremism .
republican sincerely , newt gingrich contribute paid for by mcsally for senate , inc .

republican “ arizona state troopers withdraw kyrsten sinema endorsement „ – washington free beacon , 10 / 25 / 18 i &apos;m not making this up , friend .
republican after initially announcing their support for kyrsten sinema , the arizona state troopers association pulled their endorsement after current and retired law enforcement voiced opposition to sinema .
republican friend , i stand with our law enforcement .
republican i will continue doing everything i can so they have the resources they need to keep arizonans — and all americans — safe .
republican i &apos;m thankful the arizona state troopers recognize sinema for who she is , but we need to make sure that we relay that message to all of arizona &apos;s voters ... and we &apos;re running out of time .
republican early voting is already happening , and by this time next week nearly 75-80 % of arizonans will have already voted .
republican that means we have just 11 days to triple our voter outreach efforts and expose the real kyrsten sinema to the remaining undecided voters who will decide the outcome of this race , and with it control of the senate .
republican but advertising is so expensive , and we &apos;re running out of budget .
republican will you please chip in today — whatever amount you can afford — to help fund this last phase of our campaign ?
republican kyrsten sinema &apos;s campaign should take a lesson from this : don &apos;t try to pull a fast one on arizona &apos;s law enforcement , they &apos;ll catch you !

republican friend , while this might be the second debate i &apos;m attending , it will be the first time tina smith will also be there .
republican i cannot wait to finally have the opportunity to debate tina face to face – and not an empty podium .
republican tina &apos;s decision to skip our last debate has been disastrous for her campaign .

republican karin from : karin housleydate : monday , october 22 , 2018subject : an empty podium friend , why didn &apos;t appointed democrat senator tina smith show up for our scheduled debate last night ?
republican she &apos;s afraid to answer the questions our campaign has been asking .
republican we &apos;re sure she wouldn &apos;t want to answer for supporting the largest tax hike in minnesota history .
republican and we know she wouldn &apos;t want to touch how she profited from the terrible opioid crisis – or why she and her husband have hidden so much wealth in a bermuda tax haven .
republican but maybe she was just down at that tropical vacation spot – maybe she and her husband were out enjoying their ill-gotten &quot; good life &quot; in bermuda .
republican friend , there &apos;s no doubt about it – tina smith did not show up tonight because she can &apos;t defend her disastrous and self-serving political record .
republican just take a look at her record as an out-of-touch politician .
republican tina smith may be awol last night , but we still have so much work left to help push karin over the top on november 6th .
republican now it &apos;s time for us to show up at the polls and send her packing to bermuda for good .
republican while tina smith might have skipped tonight it due to her # bigcomplicatedschedule , karin will always show up and be ready to answer questions from the people of minnesota !
republican to show karin you have her back in the final 15 days of this election , we &apos;ve set a goal of raising an additional $ 10,000 in the next 48 hours .
republican will you chip in $ 10 , $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 100 or more right now ?
republican washington doesn &apos;t need any more career politicians and it doesn &apos;t need empty podiums .
republican washington needs a new voice that will show up and listen !

republican graham , with 15 days to go until election day , we &apos;re on the verge of pulling off one of the great upsets in virginia history !
republican this is a race we can win !
republican because great friends like you joined our conservative movement , we &apos;re closing fast on professional politician , senator tim kaine , and we &apos;re within striking distance of victory .

republican masquerading as a moderate , he draws his support from the clintons and their far-left benefactors .
republican he &apos;s against building the wall .
republican he &apos;s against guns and our right to keep and bear arms .
republican he &apos;s against judges who are devoted to our constitution and most of all ...
republican he &apos;s against president donald trump .
republican the fact is , he hates him .
republican when he &apos;s not staking out the far-left stand , he &apos;s flipping and flopping on the issues virginians care about most .
republican he &apos;s done it on the offshore drilling that will make our country energy independent .
republican he &apos;s done it on abortion where he &apos;s against our culture of life .
republican in the closing days of a race that &apos;s too close to call , i need your emergency help to defeat washingtonian tim kaine .
republican please rush a contribution of $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 75 , $ 100 or even more in our hour of need .

republican friend , we just launched our latest campaign ad and as one of my closest supporters , i wanted to make sure you saw it .
republican you see , friend , tina smith is living the good life – at your expense .
republican while tina smith claims to have taken on &apos; big pharma , &apos; she &apos;s profited from the opioid crisis , owning between a quarter to a half million dollars in one of the leading marketers of oxycontin .
republican tina smith supported the biggest tax hike in state history during her 7 years in the governor &apos;s office .
republican her proposal would have created almost $ 4.5 billion in new taxes on our income in minnesota .
republican and while tina is taxing your hard-earned dollars , she &apos;s hiding her own money – up to a million dollars – in a bermuda tax shelter !
republican tina smith manufactures political outrage at the same time she cashes in on her stock dividends , advocates for a massive tax increase , and hides her money in offshore accounts .
republican it &apos;s time that minnesotan voters see tina smith &apos;s over the top hypocrisy .
republican friend , that &apos;s why i &apos;ve released this latest hard-hitting ad .
republican watch the &quot; good life &quot; ad while this ad just went live , it &apos;s already sent shockwaves around minnesota .
republican tina smith and her radical left super pacs are already trying to silence our important message with liberal dollars .
republican will you chip in $ 10 , $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 100 or more to make sure this ad continues to let voters see the true tina smith ?
republican minnesota voters aren &apos;t stupid – and they don &apos;t like hypocrites .
republican friend , if i have the resources i need to keep this ad live and break through the democrat propaganda with my commonsense conservative message , we will defeat her at the polls on november 6th .
republican please watch the ad tina smith doesn &apos;t want you to see now and share with your friends , family , and neighbors !
republican thanks , karin housley republican candidate for u.s.
republican senate watch the &quot; good life &quot; ad karin housley is a wife , mother , grandmother , small business owner , state senator , and the republican candidate for minnesota &apos;s united states senate special election .

republican friend , the democrats know that in order to win the senate majority , they must defeat me and win mississippi .
republican that &apos;s why elizabeth warren , kamala harris , and even dnc chair tom perez are campaigning for my opponent , clinton-crony mike epsy .
republican it might sound far-fetched – a democrat winning in mississippi – but my liberal opponent is getting help from deep-pocketed donors and political powerhouses and he &apos;s gaining ground .
republican i can &apos;t afford to lose my lead and that &apos;s why i need your help to widen the gap before my opponent catches up .
republican contribute reports show this race is tightening every day and the democratic machine is deploying heavy-hitter surrogates , like dnc chair , tom perez , who is headed to mississippi tomorrow .
republican tom perez , will be in mississippi tomorrow to mobilize his activist mob and court wealthy liberal donors .
republican we can &apos;t allow a former clinton appointee to win mississippi and turn the senate &apos;s majority rule into mob rule .
republican a contribution of $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 75 , $ 100 or more to my campaign will give me much needed momentum heading in this critical november election .
republican what &apos;s at stake and what we are fighting for in this election has never been higher and my opponent and i couldn &apos;t be more opposite .
republican epsy and the democrats &apos; want to win the senate majority and immediately impeach the president .
republican in order to keep that from happening and also keep our country safe , the president needs allies like me in the senate .
republican because as i reach out to you , a caravan of illegal immigrants is heading to the u.s. border .
republican a mike epsy win and a democratic senate majority will not only allow their entry but give them a &quot; right &quot; to taxpayer funded benefits .
republican mike epsy and the liberal mob are determined to see this dream become reality .
republican so friend , i &apos;m asking with your help that we stop him and the clinton machine once and for all on election day .

republican after watching every major poll predict that then candidate trump was in for an epic defeat , i know better than to trust polling numbers .
republican but i &apos;m not going to lie , this race is so close and i &apos;m being vastly outspent by sinema and the democrats because chuck schumer is not about to let his darling candidate fall short .
republican if i can &apos;t fight back , it might cost us this race .
republican liberal washington elites think this election is about them ... but it &apos;s not .

republican friend , i &apos;m proud to be an arizonan , unlike my opponent kyrsten sinema .
republican the election is already well under way and by tuesday of next week almost 75 % of voters will have already voted .
republican this election is going to be close and we must secure the remaining 25 % of votes because the outcome of the midterm elections will determine senate control , and more importantly the trajectory of our country .
republican with the future of immigration , healthcare , and taxes on the line , here are ten reasons why kyrsten sinema can never be allowed to set foot in the senate : she &apos;s anti-military and spent the days after 9 / 11 protesting the war in a pink tutu.she &apos;s a self-proclaimed prada-socialist.she labeled arizona the &quot; meth lab of democracy . &quot;
republican she told her liberal friends that arizonan &apos;s are &quot; crazy . &quot;
republican she thinks stay-at-home mothers are &quot; leeches . &quot;
republican she voted against the largest tax cuts in decades.she &apos;s voted with nancy pelosi 75 % of the time.when asked by a radio host if americans like himself could go join the taliban , kyrsten sinema said &quot; fine .
republican i don &apos;t care if you want to do that , go ahead . &quot;
republican she pretends to be in a moderate , but even the az democratic party labeled her &quot; too extreme &quot; and in a radio interview while serving in the state legislature , she claimed that she was the &quot; most liberal legislator &quot; in arizona .
republican she led protests that depicted american service men and women as skeletons and said they were causing &quot; u.s.
republican terror in iraq and the middle east . &quot;
republican these are just some of the many reasons we &apos;ve got to prevent kyrsten sinema from winning , and we &apos;ve only got 10 days to do it .
republican will you donate $ 10 or more today to help me keep sinema out of the senate ?
republican don &apos;t let sinema fool you with her bipartisan act .
republican there &apos;s nothing moderate about an anti-war , &quot; prada socialist &quot; who votes to defund ice , raise taxes , and votes like a pelosi puppet .

republican friend , the latest poll now has me leading this race by 2 points !
republican this is it , friend , this is our chance .

republican my opponent &apos;s campaign continues to distort my record and smear my name , going so far as to call me &quot; desperate &quot; and a &quot; liar . &quot;
republican i can handle the name calling , but i cannot handle sinema &apos;s distortion of my record .

republican stand strong again st the left
republican friend , things are heating up in minnesota and it &apos;s putting democrats on alert .
republican poll after poll in minnesota shows the special election to replace al franken is too close for comfort , and that has national democrats scrambling .
republican it &apos;s been called a &quot; potential upset . &quot;
republican minnesota state senator karin housley is coming within &quot; striking distance . &quot;
republican friend , i hope you &apos;ll give me a moment to introduce you to karin housley and describe why her race is so important to not only maintaining the republican majority in the senate but picking up another republican seat !
republican karin has been a state senator in the minnesota senate for the last 6 years .
republican she is a wife , mother , grandmother , and small business owner that has seen first-hand how disastrous a democrat-majority in the senate can be for hard-working americans .
republican friend , that &apos;s why i must ask you : will you support karin housley &apos;s senate race in minnesota today ?
republican in 2016 , president trump and i almost won minnesota .
republican in fact , we only lost the state by less than 45,000 votes – even with evan mcmullin taking over 50,000 votes that could have put our ticket over the top .
republican minnesota isn &apos;t the blue state it once was .
republican minnesota is turning red because the radical left has forgotten what truly matters to most americans .
republican the left is more tied up talking about washington scandal than fixing the problems that face main street , our farmers , our miners , and our veterans – the list goes on .
republican this november , karin housley will be the next great victory to come from minnesota .
republican friend , when karin wins , she will replace an obstructionist senator that has opposed our commonsense reforms since she was appointed to the senate by democrat governor mark dayton .
republican karin &apos;s opponent hasn &apos;t won a united states senate election and with your help , we &apos;ll make sure she never does !
republican let me tell you about tina smith .
republican tina is a career dc insider , and a proud member of the &quot; resistance . &quot;
republican she &apos;s a former planned parenthood executive , called a &quot; champion &quot; by planned parenthood &apos;s president , cecile richards .
republican tina will never vote to protect life - but i can promise you karin will .
republican that &apos;s why she &apos;s been endorsed by leading pro-life organizations in minnesota and nationwide .
republican tina smith has never seen a tax she didn &apos;t support and will be a &apos; yes &apos; vote for the chuck schumer / elizabeth warren agenda in washington .
republican during her short time in washington , tina has voted &apos; no &apos; on almost every single federal appointment or piece of legislation from our administration .
republican we don &apos;t need more tina smiths in the senate .
republican we need a new , fresh voice in washington .
republican we need karin housley .
republican friend , election day is less than 20 days away and karin needs your help to finish her campaign with a victory on november 6th .
republican she has the right momentum .
republican while she &apos;s tightening this race to single digits , tina smith &apos;s support is falling .
republican tina smith and the national democrats know they must defeat karin housley to win a majority in the senate .
republican they know this race is one of republicans &apos; best opportunity to pick up a seat in the senate and will spend millions to keep it .
republican karin doesn &apos;t need millions from liberal super pacs – she just needs the support of people like you .
republican will you join me in support karin housley for senate with a contribution of $ 10 , $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 100 or more right now ?
republican your support will have a profound effect on this race and will help keep the senate red !
republican i hope karin can count on you today .
republican sincerely , vice president mike pence donate today karin housley is a wife , mother , grandmother , small business owner , state senator , and the republican candidate for minnesota &apos;s united states senate special election .

republican friend , why didn &apos;t appointed democrat senator tina smith show up for our scheduled debate tonight ?
republican she &apos;s afraid to answer the questions our campaign has been asking .
republican we &apos;re sure she wouldn &apos;t want to answer for supporting the largest tax hike in minnesota history .
republican and we know she wouldn &apos;t want to touch how she profited from the terrible opioid crisis – or why she and her husband have hidden so much wealth in a bermuda tax haven .
republican but maybe she was just down at that tropical vacation spot – maybe she and her husband were out enjoying their ill-gotten &quot; good life &quot; in bermuda .
republican friend , there &apos;s no doubt about it – tina smith did not show up tonight because she can &apos;t defend her disastrous and self-serving political record .
republican just take a look at her record as an out-of-touch politician .
republican tina smith may be awol tonight , but we still have so much work left to help push karin over the top on november 6th .
republican now it &apos;s time for us to show up at the polls and send her packing to bermuda for good .
republican while tina smith might have skipped tonight it due to her # bigcomplicatedschedule , karin will always show up and be read to answer questions from the people of minnesota !
republican to show karin you have her back in the final 16 days of this election , we &apos;ve set a goal of raising an additional $ 10,000 in the next 72 hours .
republican will you chip in $ 10 , $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 100 or more right now ?
republican washington doesn &apos;t need any more career politicians and it doesn &apos;t need empty podiums .
republican washington needs a new voice that will show up and listen !

republican friend , in case you missed it , i had to share this with you .
republican the green party candidate in this race just dropped out and endorsed kyrsten sinema because they share the same far-left positions .
republican i &apos;m not surprised my opponent earned an endorsement from the green party , given she used to be a card-carrying member herself .
republican this is just more proof that kyrsten &apos;s moderate act is a total sham .
republican there &apos;s nothing moderate about the green party , and there &apos;s nothing moderate about my opponent .

republican unfortunately , due to the backhanded maneuvering of gill ibrand and her staff , there is no third-party sponsor for the debate which could provide a statewide telecast : “ after finally speaking with one of s enator gillibrand ’ s senior staffers last night , i was told that ; sunday night ’ s debate was actually initiated by gillibrand in july 2018 .
republican her office reached out to both skidmore college and spectrum ny1 to arrange her sole debate at her preferred date , time and venue .
republican the farley campaign was never consulted .
republican in se ptember 2018 , spectrum ny1 reached out to th e farley campaign about a debate on oct 21 , 2018 , at skidmore college , and &amp; # xa0 ; chele farley immediately accepted .
republican it was not until october 4 , 2018 , a fter the farley campaign sent out a press release challenging gillibrand to accept the 5 deb ate offers that had been received , that spectrum ny1 confirmed that gillibrand had accepted and would be participating .
republican after 6 pm on friday , 48 hours before t he only planned us senate debate on sunday evening october 21 , 20 18 , gillibrand sent out a statement backing out of the debate , citing an on going labor dispute that would require her to cross a “ de facto pick et line . ”
republican gillibrand had no problem crossing the same “ de fac to picket line ” on several occasions earlier this year when she appe ared on spec trum news programs .
republican gillibr and was interviewed by one of the debate moderators about gun control legislation .
republican on march 11 , 2018 , she appeared on a show to talk about the women ’ s movement . &amp; # xa0 ; the most insulting part of the whole se ries of events is at no point did anyone from gillibrand ’ s office re ach out to the farley campaign to notify us of the issue and discuss a viab le solution .
republican yet , gillibrand in her statement said , “ if not &#91; strike &#93; resolved , my campaign stands ready to debate sunday night with a different media partner or will explore another date and venue to conduct a debate before the election . ”
republican it is clear by her actions and lack of contact with the campaign , that senator gillibrand had no intention of keep ing her word .
republican she had already rejected a debate offer from news12 long island that was set for october 18 , 2018 , then rescheduled for novemb er 1 , 2018 , to accommodate gillibrand ’ s legislative schedule .
republican ( note that the senate adjourned until after the election on october 11 , 2018 , and senator gillibrand was campaigning in new hampshire on october 18 , 2018 . ) &amp; # xa0 ; gillibrand did make good on the other part o f the statement by reaching out to the albany times-union , her hometown newspaper with no ability to televise statewide , and securing them as a potential replacement host and sponsor for sunday &amp; # x2019 ; s debate .
republican only after they had set the terms with the xa0 ; times-union span , did gillibrand ’ s office finall y contact the farley campaign and offer the replacement moderators and spon sors for sunday night as a take-it-or-leave-it offer .
republican the implica tion from gillibrand ’ s office was that if farley didn ’ t accep t the debate as gillibrand ’ s office had proposed them , she was going back on what she had said about accepting all legitimate debate offers .
republican no thing could be further from the truth .
republican debates should be independent a nd fair .
republican they should be put on by third-party organizations .
republican the gillibrand campaign shouldn ’ t have been allowed to dictate the terms for the o riginal debate nor the replacement sponsors and moderators that were only n eeded because she backed out of the debate she originally planned on the ne twork she chose .
republican in most debates , there are meetings and negotiations to the terms of the debate between the sponsors and the campa igns .
republican this did not happen in this case .
republican if it had , it would have opened a d ialogue and leveled the playing field , which would have avoided the end res ult .
republican the debate as gillibrand ’ s office now designs it would not be o n statewide tv and would deny the majority of voters the opportunity t o watch the debate and make an informed decision before they vote on n ovember 6 , 2018 .
republican senator gillibrand throughout her publi c career has talked about transparency and openness .
republican she has debated in eac h of her last two senatorial campaigns and called for debates when she firs t ran for the house in 2006 .
republican last night , she walked away from this record i n a series of cold and calculated steps to avoid debating .
republican is it becau se she can ’ t explain how she plans to pay for her more than $ 40 tril lion in new spending ?
republican or , she can ’ t risk her reputation as the # meto osenator being exposed because of her connections to harvey weinstein and o thers – making her just the # mefirstsenator ?
republican or , is it because she x2019 ; s too busy running for president ?
republican she ’ s only spent one day in new york this month , while making five stops on the presidential campaign t rail in georgia , michigan , pennsylvania and tennessee before capping of a v isit to the home of the first presidential primary , new hampshire. a0 ; whatever gillibrand ’ s reasons fo r getting out of sunday night ’ s debate on tv , the message is loud an d clear .
republican she has once again failed new yorkers by putting her needs and amb itions ahead of the voters she seeks to continue representing in washington .
republican debates are a core part of campaigning and democracy , and gillibrand brok e the commitment she made to advance our democratic system .
republican chele farley is an outsider with over 25 years of experience i n the private sector .
republican she is the republican , conservative and reform party candidate for u.s.
republican farley lives in new york city with her husband r ichard and their three sons .

republican friend , the latest polling in this special election to replace al franken is scaring my opponent .
republican in fact , she emailed supporters , &quot; we have to stop her momentum . &quot;
republican friend , will you let the left get away with this ?
republican are you going to let tina smith , elizabeth warren , chuck schumer and the rest of the liberal left stop our momentum ?
republican you can make sure we continue to build our momentum in the final 11 days of this race by chipping in $ 10 , or even $ 100 dollars today !
republican so what part of this poll scared tina smith and dc democrats so badly ?
republican you see , friend , we &apos;ve made major gains where it matters most – with independents who will decide the outcome of this race .
republican we cannot take our gain for granted .
republican in order to continue building our momentum – much to the ire of the left – we need to make sure we keep ads on the air , make important voter contacts , and implement our &quot; get-out-the-vote &quot; plan in the final days .
republican your contribution of $ 10 , $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 100 or whatever you can swing today will help team housley continue to build our momentum !
republican friend , i know we can win on november 6th , but we must continue to gain our momentum !

republican now is the time to give everything we can into this race .
republican friend , i know it &apos;s old news , but i still can &apos;t stop thinking about democrats &apos; recent efforts to tear down justice kavanaugh .
republican the entire charade was truly evil .
republican the ordeal is now behind us , but it serves as a chilling reminder of how far democrats will go to win.we just passed our october mid-month fundraising deadline , and i still need your help to prepare for whatever the left is planning in their efforts to defeat me.seize the lead $ 25 seize the lead $ 50 seize the lead $ 100 seize the lead $ 250 seize the lead $ 500 seize the lead $ 1,000 as you know , the left is desperate to win in mississippi , believing this could be the sleeper race that hands them the senate majority .
republican democrats are zeroing in on me because of my conservative record and endorsement from president trump .
republican even though they are the minority party , democrats have successfully obstructed progress and incited divisiveness .
republican i can only imagine how much worse things will get if they retake the senate.we cannot legitimize their extremism , friend , but that &apos;s exactly what will happen if we lose .
republican will you help me fight to ensure that doesn &apos;t happen ?
republican i &apos;ve supported the president 100 % since day one and he &apos;s counting on me to win this race because he needs conservative allies like me to finish the job we started – making america great .
republican so please , help me reach my october mid-month fundraising goal and prepare for the next round of attacks , so i can continue fighting beside president trump in november .
republican sincerely , cindy hyde-smith united states senator ( r-ms ) seize the lead $ 25 seize the lead $ 50 seize the lead $ 100 seize the lead $ 250 seize the lead $ 500 seize the lead $ 1,000 paid for by cindy hyde-smith for us senate

republican senate candidate chele farley ( r , c , reform ) blasted kirsten gillibrand for her last-minute decision to pull o ut of sunday ’ s debate at skidmore college .
republican in withdrawing from the debate , gillibr and cited solidarity with striking charter spectrum workers who belong to t he ibew union .
republican gillibrand , like other boycotting democrats , tish james and bill de blasio , has been interviewed on numerous spectrum outlets sinc e the labor action began in march 2017 .
republican gillibrand , just yesterday was in new h ampshire , as she continued laying the groundwork for her 2020 presidential run .
republican “ new york ’ s 19 million vo ters deserve a real conversation about the issues that are facing our state but apparently kirsten gillibrand is more interested in the lives of voters in new hampshire , ” said farley .
republican she added , “ this debate has been scheduled for weeks , the only thing that has changed at spectrum is that k irsten gillibrand decided she couldn ’ t defend her absentee record of incompetence and ineffectiveness . ”
republican the decision by gillibrand , who touts h erself as one of the most “ transparent ” members of congress , marks a complete reversal from her previous races .
republican ‘ it is shocking to me that a sen ator who has spent more time on the road campaigning for 2020 , than she has re-election , would have so little respect for the voters , ” said far ley .
republican concluded farley , “ kirsten gilli brand chickened out , there are no two ways about it .
republican but i respect the vote rs and stand ready to debate her , if and when she finds the guts to stand b efore me and the people of new york , and defend her record . ” &lt; / div chele farley is an outsider with over 25 years of experience i n the private sector .
republican she is the republican , conservative and reform party candidate for u.s.
republican farley lives in new york city with her husband r ichard and their three sons .

republican this is scary , friend .
republican first , we received news that the liberal senate majority pac – the same super pac that michael bloomberg recently gave $ 20 million to – decided to make a last-minute investment of $ 400,000 in our race .
republican then , news broke that the democratic senatorial campaign committee ( dscc ) is spending just under $ 800,000 in attack ads against karin .
republican friend , that makes the left has made a total of $ 1.2 million to defeat karin and team housley in the final 5 days of this race .
republican this news is scary but it tells us one important thing ... ... the democrats and liberal left are scared .
republican they are afraid because they know karin is about to win this race and dc democrats are going to try and stop her .
republican but you can help us fight back , friend .
republican will you chip in $ 10 or more to help karin in the final 5 days ?
republican thanks , team housley from : karin housleydate : wednesday , october 31 , 2018subject : 4oo , ooo reasons to get involved friend – i have some breaking news , and it &apos;s not good .
republican liberal super pac , senate majority pac , is spending another $ 400,000 to defeat me .
republican this last minute buy is because dc democrats and their liberal megadonors are scared .
republican they are scared because they &apos;ve seen the momentum we &apos;ve built .
republican they know this race is a toss-up and think with an additional $ 400,000 , they can buy a tina smith victory on november 6th .
republican friend , i am afraid they could buy this race out from under us with such a large investment this late in the game .
republican friend , will you help me fight against the dems dark money ?
republican chip in $ 25 chip in $ 50 chip in $ 75 chip in $ 100 chip in $ 250 chip in $ 500 chip in different amount the senate majority pac &apos;s dollars are funded by the likes of george soros , michael bloomberg , and bill maher – who have given more than $ 20 million to defeat people like me alone .
republican the left is going to do and spend whatever they can to erase our republican majority in the senate ...
republican this race has been nothing but bad news for democrats thanks to al franken .
republican when former senator al franken was forced to resign in disgrace , he really messed things up for the left .
republican liberal super pacs know that # noshowtina is a reluctant candidate who is wrong on all the issues for minnesota .
republican while democrats have done nothing but cause gridlock and promote radicalism , conservatives have passed president trump &apos;s reforms – lowering taxes , strengthening our borders , and creating jobs .
republican our conservative achievements are winning over voters , and democrats are struggling to hold this seat .
republican we know this is conservatives &apos; best opportunity to pick up a seat , and the left is going to do whatever they can to stop us from winning .
republican friend , please help however you can to help me fight back this $ 400,000 investment from the liberal super pacs who &apos;s &quot; solely dedicated to building a democratic majority in the u.s.
republican chip in whatever you can today !

republican friend , with just 22 days left until election day , things are really coming together in this pivotal special election senate race !
republican have you seen the latest new poll , friend ?
republican just three points down , friend – with just over three weeks to go – we are in the perfect position to earn just a few more undecided voters and erase that rapidly-closing gap on november 6th !
republican friend that means our most important task in these final decisive weeks is ensuring that our winning message continues to connect with the many uncommitted minnesotans who are only now focusing on the campaign .
republican we must re-double our outreach while we roll out our all-important get-out-the vote programs to make sure voters are motivated to actually go to the polls !
republican friend , will you please help us reach the maximum number of undecided voters with our winning commonsense conservative message and spur record turn-out on election day with your urgent three weeks out contribution right now ?
republican we know minnesota taxpayers are fed up by taxin &apos; tina &apos;s obstruction in washington , and with your help , we &apos;ll flip this seat in november , but we must make every possible voter contact effort while we still have time .
republican i hope i can count on your support right now with a contribution of $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 75 or even $ 100 or more today !
republican close the gap → $ 10 close the gap → $ 25 close the gap → $ 50 close the gap → $ 75 close the gap → $ 100 close the gap → another contribution we &apos;re so close to winning this race , but we &apos;re going to need every able-bodied conservative leader to sign on in the final 22 days .
republican help us close the gap and win on november 6th !

republican if there isn &apos;t a clear choice for arizona &apos;s senate seat now , you didn &apos;t see tonight &apos;s debate .
republican tonight , i showed arizonans a crystal clear picture of what kyrsten sinema will be like if elected .
republican and more importantly , i showed what i will do for americans when arizonans elect me to the u.s.
republican tonight &apos;s debate was about making a clear contrast between myself and a self-proclaimed &quot; prada socialist . &quot;
republican and we certainly did that !
republican here &apos;s the thing though friend , i &apos;ve been off the debate stage less than 30 minutes , and liberals and their fake news allies are already twisting my words into complete lies .
republican voting is already underway here in arizona — if we don &apos;t cut the bs immediately before it spirals out of control , we may not recover .
republican we need to raise another $ 100,000 before midnight tomorrow to stop the democrats &apos; fake news attacks in its tracks — will you pitch in ?
republican pitch in i know i &apos;ve asked a lot of you already , and i appreciate you having my back .
republican but the democrats are terrified — and it &apos;s making them more ruthless than ever .
republican so if you can afford it ...
republican i could use all the help i can get .

republican democrats led by gillibrand abandoning israel new york , new york -- new york ’ s senior senator and se nate minority leader chuck schumer today attempted to defend the indefensib le , claiming that “ senate democrats are very strongly pro-israel and will remain that way . ”
republican schumer made the remarks in response to a new york times article yesterday , “ ; a new wave of democrats tests the party ’ s blanket supp ort for israel . ”
republican the article cited a cl uster of activist democrats who “ dared to breach what has been an al most inviolable orthodoxy in both political parties , strong support for isr ael , raising the specter of a crack in the democratic party that republican s could use to attract jewish supporters . ”
republican “ chuck schumer must have missed the memo .
republican over the past year , new york ’ s junior senator kirsten gill ibrand has actually led the charge to systematically undermine and abandon israel , ” said farley .
republican the facts are clear .
republican kirsten gillibrand turned her back on the jewish state when she : opposed ending the iran nuclear deal ; voted against the taylor force act .
republican named for a west point grad uate slain by a palestinian terrorist , the legislation prevents us taxpayer funds from flowing to the families of terrorists ; abandoned her sponsorship of anti-bds legislation following pre ssure from the anti-israel left ; embraced radical anti-israel zealots like linda sarsour who cal l senator gillibrand “ another champion , another one of our people wh o works for us on the inside . ”
republican “ chuck schumer needs to wake up .
republican kirsten gillibrand has her eyes set on the white house , she will throw any thing , anyone -- a political ally or a long-standing us ally like israel -- under the bus in blind pursuit of her ambition , ” said farley .
republican farley concluded , “ if elected , i will always stand strong with our ally israel and the nearly 2 million jew s who call new york home . ”
republican chele farley is an outsider with over 25 years of experience i n the private sector .
republican she is the republican , conservative and reform party candidate for u.s.
republican farley lives in new york city with her husband r ichard and their three sons .

republican friend , democrats believe they have a real chance at retaking the senate this november , and it &apos;s easy to understand why given their hollywood donor base and partnership with the anti-trump media.but there &apos;s one thing democrats don &apos;t have and can &apos;t buy – cindy hyde-smith .
republican cindy is the conservative republican senator now serving mississippi .
republican the outcome of cindy &apos;s race may very well determine who controls the senate majority , which is why it is so important that we band together to help cindy win .
republican help cindy win : $ 25 help cindy win : $ 50 help cindy win : $ 75 help cindy win : $ 100 friend , this is not your ordinary senate race .

republican friend , the midterm elections are less than one month away , and i think there &apos;s a very real possibility of a senate upset .
republican you see , republicans narrow senate majority is in real jeopardy , but thanks to conservatives like u.s.
republican senate candidate karin housley , we have a real shot at an upset in minnesota , which is exactly the kind of midterm victory we need to hold the senate .

republican will you join me in supporting karin housley &apos;s campaign to drive out the democrats ?
republican karin is running for senate in minnesota against democrats &apos; appointee , dc insider tina smith .
republican democrats thought the former planned parenthood executive would guarantee an easy win , but thanks to karin housley , tina smith is in trouble .
republican donate today while democrats have spent the last two years running further to the left , republican majorities have spent that time fighting their resistance and delivering results .
republican karin , like many americans , grew tired of the left &apos;s increasing radicalism , which has burdened small businesses , raised our taxes , and weakened our security .
republican the difference is , karin decided to do something about it and that &apos;s why she &apos;s running to win &quot; al franken &apos;s &quot; senate seat .
republican friend , minnesotans haven &apos;t elected a republican senator in over a decade , but karin has a real shot at an upset victory .
republican will you help her deliver the defeat democrats never planned for ?
republican donate today karin &apos;s picking up speed in minnesota because her campaign message resonates with voters .
republican she represents results where her opponent represents the resistance .
republican karin is a small business owner , state legislator , a wife , and a mother , so she gets it .
republican karin gets that our leaders are responsible for delivering on the conservative reforms we were promised , and when democrats obstructed our progress , karin decided to do something about it .
republican conservative candidates like karin are the key to defeating democrats and saving our senate majority , and with less than 25 days to go , we can &apos;t wait another minute to pitch in and help karin win .

republican imp ortant ; } } our country is now back on the right t rack and we must keep it that way .
republican friend , the way many democrats have conducted themselves over the last two years has been a disgrace , and americans like you deserve better .
republican fortunately , we finally have the chance to unseat every last obstructionist and socialist in the senate , but we can &apos;t do it without conservative allies like martha mcsally .
republican martha is running for u.s.
republican senate in arizona , and this race is easily one of the most competitive in the country .
republican democrats are spending tens of millions of dollars to defeat martha and she needs us with her to hold arizona and save the senate .
republican contribute » contribute $ 25 » contribute $ 50 » contribute $ 100 » contribute $ 250 » contribute $ 500 » contribute $ 1000 » right now , polls show this race is a dead heat .
republican democrats set their sights on martha long ago because she &apos;s got a big reputation in congress as a conservative fighter .
republican unlike some of the left &apos;s failed candidates who campaigned on &quot; breaking the glass ceiling , &quot; martha mcsally actually did it .
republican before she became a member of congress , martha served in the air force for more than two decades and was the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat .
republican in washington , martha brought that same fearlessness to congress as she battled democrats &apos; efforts to raise taxes , open our borders , and shrink our military .

republican friend , i &apos;m in arizona tomorrow to rally the base and make sure we elect my friend martha mcsally .
republican martha was the united states &apos; first female fighter pilot to fly in combat and is running for the open arizona senate seat against chuck schumer &apos;s hand-picked candidate , a self-proclaimed &apos; prada-socialist . &apos; 
republican it &apos;s the seat that will likely determine the senate majority — and she needs our help to win .
republican i &apos;m proud to support martha mcsally for u.s.
republican senate ... are you friend ?
republican support martha › › › martha &apos;s conservative reputation in congress has placed her at the top of democrats &apos; hit list , which is motivating wealthy liberals like george soros and tom steyer to pour millions into arizona to destroy her .
republican friend , we cannot let the democrats buy this seat , and with it control of the senate .
republican we &apos;ve got to come together and defend martha against the democratic machine and dark money attacks .
republican will you stand with me and support martha with an immediate contribution to her senate campaign ?
republican support martha › › › martha mcsally supports our america first agenda .
republican i know this because martha has spent her career fighting for americans .
republican she &apos;s deployed overseas and faced terrorists in combat .
republican martha understands the true price of freedom better than most — something liberals seem to forget , or simply ignore .
republican like me , she &apos;s committed to closing the deadly loopholes that have allowed dangerous criminal organizations like ms-13 to flood our borders and threaten our safety .
republican friend , i need conservative allies like martha mcsally by my side this november to protect our senate majority so we can continue to put america first and extremism last .
republican i hope i can count on you today to stand with me and help martha win .
republican trump president of the united states p.s.
republican remember friend , this race is much bigger than arizona .
republican your immediate contribution is not only supporting martha mcsally for senate , it &apos;s deciding who controls the senate .

republican friend , during my recent debate against my liberal opponent , i confronted her about her reprehensible comments on committing treason and demanded an apology .
republican sinema &apos;s comments are absolutely disgusting .
republican when a radio show asked whether sinema thought it was ok for americans to go join the taliban , sinema responded with ...
republican i don &apos;t care if you want to do that , go ahead . &quot;
republican these comments alone disqualify her from representing arizona in the u.s.
republican as a veteran combat pilot and staunch advocate for our military , i take this very personally .
republican friend , our senators are responsible for making decisions that deeply affect our military and a candidate who &quot; doesn &apos;t care &quot; if americans defect to fight for the taliban against our troops should never set foot in the senate .
republican if you agree , help me stop my opponent , protestor kyrsten sinema .
republican my opponent will try to tell you her statements were taken out of context , but even cnn said that the comment were &quot; not at all out of context &quot; and they was actually &quot; in context and sinema just didn &apos;t want to answer the question .
republican i spent 26 years serving this country and went on to become the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat .
republican after 9 / 11 , i was dropping bombs on the taliban , while my opponent kyrsten sinema was protesting military action in a pink tutu .
republican that &apos;s the difference between the two of us : kyrsten can dress it up in a pink tutu all she wants , but treason is treason .

republican friend , one of the most critical races in these historic 2018 mid-term elections is rapidly drawing to a close in arizona -- rep .
republican martha mcsally &apos;s huge effort to keep the u.s.
republican senate seat in republican hands .
republican it &apos;s been a tough race against an obama-clinton democrat opponent with the whole national left-wing establishment behind her , but martha is no stranger to a tough fight .
republican she &apos;s an air force colonel , the first american woman to fly in combat in her a-10 thunderbolt ii , and the first to lead a squadron into battle , too .
republican and martha has been a strong conservative leader in the congress , fighting for national security , our veterans , and less taxes and regulation for more prosperity for all americans -- and we need her toughness and leadership now in the u.s.

republican 10 days : the fighter pilot vs.
republican the protester friend , i &apos;m writing you because everything we &apos;ve worked so hard to accomplish in the last two years is on the line .
republican all eyes are on arizona &apos;s u.s.
republican senate race because the outcome could very well determine who controls the majority , and if the democrat mob wins -- it will be a disaster .
republican unfortunately , that is exactly what could happen !
republican according to all the most recent polls , this race is virtually tied !
republican that &apos;s why i &apos;m personally asking you : will you stop what you &apos;re doing and join me in supporting martha mcsally for senate ?
republican she knows what it takes to defend our nation .
republican you see : while democrat candidate kyrsten sinema was busy protesting military action in a pink tutu , martha mcsally was serving as a fighter pilot in the u.s.
republican air force and dropping bombs on the taliban.who do you trust to lead and protect our nation ?
republican martha mcsallycombat-tested leader kyrsten sinemaproud member of the democrat mob friend , i can &apos;t think of anyone more quailified than martha mcsally when it comes to joining the u.s.
republican senate and leading the fight to preserve and protect our nation .
republican as a veteran of operation iraqi freedom , believe me when i say no amount of protesting will keep our nation safe against terrorists like isis or rouge nation-states like iran -- martha mcsally understands this ...
republican kyrsten sinema does not .
republican that &apos;s why i &apos;m personally asking you to drop what you &apos;re doing and make an urgent donation to support martha mcsally &apos;s campaign .

republican friend , the # 1 issue that always unites republicans is our rock-solid commitment to a strong national defense -- it &apos;s why i ran for congress after 26 years of service in the air force as the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat in us history -- to help fill the leadership vacuum president barack obama created !
republican friend , one of my most important and proudest achievements in congress has been helping retain our united states air force a-10 thunderbolt ii close air support aircraft , more affectionately known as the &quot; warthog , &quot; and if you will step forward right now and be a &quot; wingman &quot; for my historic campaign for the u.s.
republican senate here in arizona with your generous contribution of $ 250 or more today , i &apos;ll send you a unique and really cool replica of the &quot; warthog &quot; that you can proudly display !
republican report for duty today with your urgent $ 250 contribution to martha mcsally for senate and receive your a-10 &quot; warthog &quot; !
republican contribute ✈ friend , we have just 3 more weeks in this pivotal arizona campaign for u.s.
republican senate and it &apos;s no secret that these are perilous times ... ...
republican while i &apos;m a skeptical optimist on north korea due to president donald trump &apos;s maximum pressure campaign , the kim regime remains unpredictable and nuclear testing could start again at a moment &apos;s notice ... ...
republican afghanistan remains an intense , heavy conflict zone ... ...
republican china just passed its largest-ever military budget and has been conducting submarine-intensive war games in the south china sea in an attempt to challenge america &apos;s dominance on the ocean ... ...
republican russian president vladimir putin is using energy resources to exert control over our enemies and allies ... ...
republican as one of only nine members of congress whose district runs along the southern border , i see firsthand the danger of open borders .
republican americans deserve safety from drug cartels , criminal gangs , and human traffickers ...
republican meanwhile , due to years of defense department sequestration under president obama , our military is not even close to being prepared to confront and defeat these growing threats .
republican the air force alone lacks much-needed spare parts and enough proficient pilots to maintain america &apos;s air superiority .
republican friend , after logging over 325 combat flight hours , i can &apos;t overstate the importance of training for every possible terrain and every possible scenario !
republican thankfully , we &apos;re finally starting to make a course correction .
republican under the leadership of president trump and republican combat veterans in congress like me , the federal government is finally responding to the needs of our military !
republican among my many accomplishments , i &apos;m most proud of my successful efforts to save the a-10 .
republican not because i used to fly it -- the t-37 plane that i also flew is already in the &quot; boneyard &quot; -- but because it &apos;s empirically the best close air support platform in our military arsenal .
republican report for duty today with your urgent $ 250 contribution to martha mcsally for senate and receive your a-10 &quot; warthog &quot; !
republican contribute ✈ all too frequently , it &apos;s literally the difference between life and death for soldiers pinned down in a fire fight !
republican furthermore , republicans in congress just passed , and president trump signed , a two-year defense budget that increases funding to $ 700 billion this year and $ 716 billion in 2019 .
republican that &apos;s not just spending for the sake of spending .
republican this spending gives our fighting men and women long-overdue resources for training , updates our military equipment , and puts us back on the path to military readiness to fight tonight if called .
republican but as great as this two-year funding plan is , ultimately i liken it to putting a tourniquet on a wound .
republican recovering our full military readiness after the damage inflicted by sequestration will take years under the best of circumstances .
republican that &apos;s why it &apos;s absolutely critical i defeat my liberal democrat opponent kyrsten sinema for arizona &apos;s u.s.
republican senate seat on november 6th .
republican kyrsten sinema has been no friend to the military as a left-wing member of congress who supports nancy pelosi .
republican in fact , she has a long history of protesting our service men and women .
republican her victory this november would not only clear a path for chuck schumer to become senate majority leader ... ...
republican it would further reduce the already badly depleted number of military veterans serving in congress at one of the most dangerous points in history !
republican i &apos;m determined not to let that happen , but i can only win if every republican is united behind me .
republican friend , i &apos;m asking for your immediate help because i truly need it -- and i &apos;ll gladly send you our official 2018 mcsally for senate a-10 &quot; warthog &quot; replica to remind you of our shared vision and our core beliefs right away when you make a generous martha mcsally for u.s.

republican friend , this race has been nothing but bad news for democrats thanks to al franken .
republican when former senator al franken was forced to resign in disgrace , he really messed things up for the left .
republican they thought they had this race in the bag – until i won the nomination .
republican now thanks to your support , i &apos;m closing in on this seat and if i can continue gaining ground for the next 25 days , i know we can turn this seat red .
republican will you help me keep it up ?
republican friend , minnesota hasn &apos;t elected a republican senator in 16 years , but that could all change in 25 days .
republican you see , minnesota came within 1.5 points of going red for president trump in 2016 .
republican it makes sense given the extremisms like elizabeth warren , al franken , keith ellison , and chuck schumer , who are bound and determined on a left-wing revival .
republican while democrats have done nothing but cause gridlock and promote radicalism , conservatives have passed president trump &apos;s reforms – lowering taxes , strengthening our borders , and creating jobs .
republican now , our conservative achievements are winning over voters , and democrats are struggling to hold this seat .
republican al franken &apos;s misconduct created a very bad situation for democrats and voters , but we have the chance to turn it into something good .

republican as the mother of four , the grandmother of two , a business owner , a state senator and now the candidate for the united states senate , i &apos;m doing my best to live those same values : work hard .

republican those eight words are at the vital core of our campaign and they are the reason we &apos;re gaining ground and within striking distance of beating our liberal-appointed opponent .
republican since you are among my best supporters , please do everything you can to stand with me again and lead us to victory with your contribution of $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 75 , $ 100 or even more today .
republican you &apos;ll help us keep our tv , radio and internet ads going !
republican i &apos;m excited about the progress our campaign is making and the momentum you &apos;ve made possible .
republican there are two new polls out that show how far we &apos;ve come and how far our great supporters like you have brought us .
republican one poll has us down just seven points and closing fast on incumbent smith .
republican another poll shows us down just 4 points – within the margins of error .
republican here &apos;s the news that brightens my day and brings joy to my heart : nearly 20 % of minnesota voters are undecided and with fewer than 26 days to go until election day , we &apos;re zeroing in on the ones who have not made up their mind .
republican our story is spreading .
republican our conservative message is connecting .
republican we &apos;re playing fair , telling the truth about tina smith &apos;s radical record and doing the right thing by voters by treating them with respect and sharing our views on today &apos;s most vital issues .
republican the polls show that the gap is closing , we &apos;re within striking distance and we can win .
republican here &apos;s the reason : minnesotans are looking for a fresh new voice and they &apos;ve heard the stale old partisan voices of the failed status quo long enough .
republican they &apos;re sick of it .
republican please help us finish strong with your generous election winning contribution of $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 75 , $ 100 or even more today !

republican i wish i didn &apos;t have to ask this of you .
republican we &apos;re about to launch a new television ad but , to be honest , we don &apos;t have the resources we need .
republican friend , we must raise an additional $ 100,000 before midnight on monday to launch this ad on tuesday or we &apos;ll have to make major cuts to our campaign .
republican i know this sounds like a lot of money , friend – it is .
republican but i also know that if each member of team housley chipping in $ 25 or even $ 10 , we &apos;d be able to make up this shortfall .
republican and friend , if you step up today , i &apos;ll make sure you &apos;re one of the first to see it as soon as it &apos;s finalized .
republican friend , it &apos;s critical that this ad is seen in the final week of this election .
republican i &apos;ve heard from so many of you across the state after tina did not show up for last weekend &apos;s debate .
republican they are truly frustrated by # noshowtina .
republican tina smith went to washington , but she still hasn &apos;t shown up for us .
republican there are 10 days until this race is over .
republican we cannot wake up on november 7th and wish we did more .
republican that &apos;s why i &apos;m working around the clock to reach out to undecided voters in the final days .
republican friend , you &apos;ve already done so much for me , but i hope i can count on you once again to fund this ad .
republican i wouldn &apos;t ask if this wasn &apos;t important and having your support mean the world to me .

republican he &apos;s against guns and our right to keep and bear arms .
republican he &apos;s against judges who are devoted to our constitution and most of all ...
republican he &apos;s against president donald trump .
republican the fact is , he hates him .
republican when he &apos;s not staking out the far-left stand , he &apos;s flipping and flopping on the issues virginians care about most .
republican he &apos;s done it on the offshore drilling that will make our country energy independent .
republican he &apos;s done it on abortion where he &apos;s against our culture of life .
republican in the closing days of a race that &apos;s too close to call , i need your emergency help to defeat washingtonian tim kaine .

republican friend – yesterday , karin emailed you about the latest polling for this special election to replace al franken .
republican we &apos;re very excited about this new poll , but we can &apos;t lose track of the work yet to be done , especially with our pre-general primary deadline less than 36 hours away .
republican karin has so much on her plate right now , and the last thing we want her to worry about it missing this huge deadline .
republican that &apos;s why we are emailing you while karin &apos;s on the campaign trail reaching out to undecided voters ...
republican will you help bring us one contribution closer to our pre-general goal ?
republican karin &apos;s liberal opponent and democrat insiders will be watching closely how much we raised since our last filing deadline on september 30th .
republican if we don &apos;t put up big numbers , liberal super pacs will know they can buy this race with a few big media buys in the final 21 days .
republican we cannot let that happen .
republican can karin and team housley count on you chip in $ 10 or more before midnight tomorrow ? !
republican thanks , team housley from : karin housleydate : monday , october 17 , 2018subject : new poll : gaining ground friend , with just 22 days left until election day , things are really coming together in this pivotal special election senate race !
republican have you seen the latest new poll , friend ?
republican just three points down , friend – with just over three weeks to go – we are in the perfect position to earn just a few more undecided voters and erase that rapidly-closing gap on november 6th !
republican friend that means our most important task in these final decisive weeks is ensuring that our winning message continues to connect with the many uncommitted minnesotans who are only now focusing on the campaign .
republican we must re-double our outreach while we roll out our all-important get-out-the vote programs to make sure voters are motivated to actually go to the polls !
republican friend , will you please help us reach the maximum number of undecided voters with our winning commonsense conservative message and spur record turn-out on election day with your urgent three weeks out contribution right now ?
republican we know minnesota taxpayers are fed up by taxin &apos; tina &apos;s obstruction in washington , and with your help , we &apos;ll flip this seat in november , but we must make every possible voter contact effort while we still have time .
republican i hope i can count on your support right now with a contribution of $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 75 or even $ 100 or more today !
republican close the gap → $ 10 close the gap → $ 25 close the gap → $ 50 close the gap → $ 75 close the gap → $ 100 close the gap → another contribution we &apos;re so close to winning this race , but we &apos;re going to need every able-bodied conservative leader to sign on in the final 22 days .

republican last night , i was with president trump rallying for the america first agenda and the level of support was unbelievable .
republican it &apos;s clear that voters support our fight to protect tax cuts , create jobs , and secure our borders .
republican unfortunately , president trump &apos;s support for me ( and mine for him ) has only further enraged the left , and it &apos;s just a matter of hours before they launch their next attack on me .
republican will you help me prepare for the next wave of attacks ?
republican to be honest , i already know what &apos;s coming .

republican defeat democrats &apos; radical hit job and multi-million-dollar attacks .
republican friend , after weeks of enduring the left &apos;s vicious threats , smears , and delay tactics , the senate finally voted to confirm brett kavanaugh to the supreme court , and let me just say , it &apos;s about time .
republican the blatant character assassination against justice kavanaugh is a stark reminder of what we &apos;re up against and what we &apos;re in for if we do not save the senate from a democratic takeover .
republican the vicious confirmation battle was a loud message to president trump &apos;s allies , like me , that no conservative will be safe if we lose the senate .
republican that &apos;s why i am doing everything in my power to win this race , and i need your help to do it .
republican donate just hours after the senate voted to confirm president trump &apos;s scotus nominee , democrats were already beating the drum for justice kavanaugh &apos;s impeachment .
republican their partisanship is so transparent its mind boggling .
republican democrats knew their political hit-job against kavanaugh was totally devoid of facts , but they did it anyway just to delay the process .
republican the left knew justice kavanaugh was never going to be a crusader for their unconstitutional extremism so they unleased the liberal mob on him .
republican friend , i &apos;ve stood with the president since day one and i stood with him in support of justice kavanaugh &apos;s confirmation .
republican now , my conservative loyalty has put me at the top of the left &apos;s hit list and i need your help to fight back .
republican donate my record has infuriated the left , who know mississippi will decide which party will control the senate majority and will stop at nothing to see me and my conservative beliefs defeated .
republican with less than a month until election day to help me continue the president &apos;s america-first , conservative agenda , i must know you &apos;re standing with us .
republican this election will impact the future of our country and mississippi for generations to come .
republican these last few weeks have only proved once again why it &apos;s critical we don &apos;t hand power back to democrats and the liberal mob , and why it &apos;s absolutely critical we keep the senate red this november .

republican we talked tariffs , taxes , freedom and free markets and enjoyed seeing so many west tennesseans.rolling , rolling , rolling up the mississippi river then marsha popped on the kustoff for congress bus tour and we rolled past cotton fields and river banks on a bustling road trip hitting all the stops and listening to tennesseans .
republican the continue to say to us : secure the border , keep the tax cuts coming , continue to grow the economy and keep this nation safe .
republican they want more constitutional judges and think the manner in which the senate democrats treated brett kavanaugh was appalling.we are working all weekend so come hang out with marsha and friends this weekend , marsha will be in chattanooga for a get out the vote rally with congressman chuck fleischmann and then on sunday in nashville with senator lindsey graham to unite the republican party and keep the republican senate majority .

republican friend , like millions of americans , i was disgusted by senate democrats &apos; behavior during justice kavanaugh &apos;s confirmation battle .
republican the hearings were a sham .
republican senate democrats confirmed that they are so blinded by their trump-hating partisanship that they &apos;re willing to destroy any conservative that gets in their way .
republican this is exactly why we cannot let the democrats take back power .
republican we &apos;ve got to help elect conservative fighters like martha mcsally to the u.s.
republican fight with martha › › › martha is a proven fighter .
republican as the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat , she &apos;s taken on terrorists in the middle east and gone head to head with democrats in congress .
republican as democrats try to seize the senate and enact their liberal agenda , our conservative majority has never needed leaders like martha more .
republican democrats in washington made the supreme court confirmation process a circus , and they aren &apos;t ready to back down .
republican friend , if we do not elect bold conservatives like martha mcsally , democrats will abuse the power of the majority to launch baseless witch hunts against any republican who rejects their radicalism .
republican fight with martha › › › as i watch the left pour millions into smearing and tearing down martha &apos;s reputation , it proves to me - once again - that she &apos;s exactly the kind of conservative ally we need in the senate .
republican martha &apos;s an unwavering advocate for a strong national defense , border security , and government reforms that put americans first .
republican her positions are an affront to senate democrats &apos; agenda , and they &apos;ll do anything to tear her down .
republican martha has spent her career fighting for us , and i know she &apos;ll do the same in the senate .
republican so please , fight with me today and let &apos;s send a proven fighter — martha mcsally — to take on the left &apos;s mob rule .

republican friend , like millions of americans , i was disgusted by senate democrats &apos; behavior during justice kavanaugh &apos;s confirmation battle .
republican the hearings were a sham .
republican senate democrats confirmed that they are so blinded by their trump-hating partisanship that they &apos;re willing to destroy any conservative that gets in their way .
republican this is exactly why we cannot let the democrats take back power .
republican we &apos;ve got to help elect conservative fighters like martha mcsally to the u.s.
republican fight with martha › › › martha is a proven fighter .
republican as the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat , she &apos;s taken on terrorists in the middle east and gone head to head with democrats in congress .
republican as democrats try to seize the senate and enact their liberal agenda , our conservative majority has never needed leaders like martha more .
republican democrats in washington made the supreme court confirmation process a circus , and they aren &apos;t ready to back down .
republican friend , if we do not elect bold conservatives like martha mcsally , democrats will abuse the power of the majority to launch baseless witch hunts against any republican who rejects their radicalism .
republican fight with martha › › › as i watch the left pour millions into smearing and tearing down martha &apos;s reputation , it proves to me - once again - that she &apos;s exactly the kind of conservative ally we need in the senate .
republican martha &apos;s an unwavering advocate for a strong national defense , border security , and government reforms that put americans first .
republican her positions are an affront to senate democrats &apos; agenda , and they &apos;ll do anything to tear her down .
republican martha has spent her career fighting for us , and i know she &apos;ll do the same in the senate .
republican so please , fight with me today and let &apos;s send a proven fighter — martha mcsally — to take on the left &apos;s mob rule .

republican the week with team chele &lt; / div on octo ber 14 , i met with and listened to residents of five towns , a grouping of villages and hamlets in western nassau county .
republican w hile on my visit , i reiterated my strong backing for israel and the se curity of the jewish state .
republican thank you to members of the five towns jewish p olitical action coalition for their time and support .
republican october 14 was also t he publication date of my n ew york post profile , which you can read here or by clicking on the pict ure below .
republican sinc e the very beginning of my campaign for us senate , i have repeatedly pointe d to senator kirsten gillibrand &apos;s non-stop auditioning for the white house in 2020 as an example of her failure to serve the people of new york .
republican on oc tober 15 , i did it again , documenting gillibrand &apos;s long history of misleadi ng voters for her own political gain .
republican for instance , according to her public schedule and media reports , gillibrand had spent just one day in the first two weeks of october in the empire state .
republican the remainder has been on t he presidential campaign trail in places like georgia , michigan , penns ylvania , tennessee and , most recently , new hampshire .
republican senator gillibrand , t ell the voters the truth about your intentions before they vote on election day , november 6 .
republican read my full statement on the topic here .
republican kirsten gillibrand has a dangerous plan in store for n ew yorkers .
republican she wants to &quot; get rid of &quot; the u.s.
republican immigration and customs enforcement agency , also known as ice .
republican as the first sitting us senator to call for abolishing ice , gillibrand has set herself far outside the mainstr eam and against the well-being of those she supposedly represents .
republican on october 15 , i released a brand-new statewide digital advertisement calling out g illibrand &apos;s plan to abolish ice .
republican called &quot; lunacy , &quot; the ad highlights the cri me-prevention effects of ice : the agency arrested criminals responsible for more than 76,000 dangerous drug offenses , 48,000 assaults , 2,000 kidn appings and almost 2,000 murders in the last year alone .
republican of course , ice is the primary deterrent force protecting long islanders and others from the v iolent ms-13 gang .
republican watch the ad here or by clicking on the image above , and read my full press release here .
republican chuck schumer must have missed the memo .
republican this week new york &apos;s senior senator claimed that &quot; senate democrats are very strongl y pro-israel and will remain that way . ”
republican he must not be paying attent ion to his own senate colleague , kirsten gillibrand .
republican over the past yea r , new york ’ s junior senator kirsten gillibrand has actually led the charge to systematically undermine and abandon israel .
republican for instance , gilli brand removed her name from anti-bds legislation after pressure from the an ti-israel left -- the same bds movement schumer earlier this year called an ti-semitic .
republican read my oct ober 17 press release here to l earn more .
republican make no mistake : louis farrakhan is an anti-semit e .
republican he &apos;s also the old-guard darling of the radical , anti-israel le ft , which means he &apos;s associated with linda sarsour and her close ally , kirsten gillibrand .
republican this week farrakhan compared jews to insects , an action which i publicly condemned .
republican campaigning outsid e the state for her presidential bid .
republican on october 18 , i condemned her f ailure to speak out against this distilled and vicious anti-semitism .
republican read my press statement here .
republican also on october 18 , i had the pleasure of visiting wit h yeshiva students in the village of lawrence , long island , at the ram bam mesivta maimonides high school .
republican i reiterated my support for a strong an d secure israel , and criticized kirsten gillibrand for her support of the d isastrous iran nuclear deal , among other things .
republican special thanks to tow n of hempstead councilman bruce blakeman , assemblywoman missy miller a nd principal rabbi yotav eliach for their support .
republican october 18 was also spent in the village of cedarhurst , greeting shoppers and discussing my candidacy for us senate at kosher grocer gourmet glatt .
republican once again i was joined by town of hempstead councilman bruce blakema n and assemblywoman missy miller .
republican also on october 18 , i attended the new york state conservative party fall reception .
republican the event brought together conservative party leaders from around the state .
republican &quot; fox &amp; friends &quot; co-host pete hegseth was the featured guest speaker .
republican i look forward to carrying the con servative party &apos;s nomination to election day , november 6 , when our campaign defeats radical liberal kirsten gillibrand and returns values and fiscal s anity to new york .
republican on &lt; / span october 19 , i criticized kirsten gillibrand for her repeated calls to abolish ice in light of a new televised report on cbs news describing ms-13 recruitment methods that target children as young as 10 years old .
republican as a mother of three , this brutality shocks and disgusts me .
republican as your senator i will stand up for ice and protect its mission to arre st and deport violent criminals like ms-3 gang members .
republican the algemeiner , an internationally focused news outlet for a jewish audience , interviewed me on october 19 .
republican i discussed my us senate platform , israel-us relations , iran and the spread of i ranian influence in its region and around the globe , the rise of anti-semit ism at home and abroad , principle threats to us security today , and the ant i-semitic boycott , divestment and sanctions movement .

republican friend , cindy is the only conservative candidate in this race who has sided with the president 100 % of the time , and who has received his full endorsement .
republican but in order for cindy to increase her lead over her opponents , like chris mcdaniel , she needs support from hard-working , constitutional conservatives like you .

republican this race will determine the future of not only mississippi but our country .
republican and in order for cindy to bring your voice to d.c. , she must defeat phony conservatives like chris mcdaniel .
republican cindy is not pretending to support the president &apos;s agenda , she has supported it 100 % since day one .

republican “ arizona state troopers withdraw krsten sinema endorsement „ – washington free beacon , 10 / 25 / 18 i &apos;m not making this up , friend .
republican after initially announcing their support of sinema , the arizona state troopers association have now pulled their endorsement after current and retired law enforcement voice opposition to sinema .
republican friend , i stand with our law enforcement .
republican i will continue doing everything i can so they have the resources they need to keep arizonans — and all americans — safe .
republican i &apos;m thankful the arizona state troopers recognize sinema for who she is , but we need to make sure that we relay that message to all of arizona &apos;s voters ... and we &apos;re running out of time .
republican early voting is already happening , and by this time next week nearly 75-80 % of arizonans will have already voted .
republican that means we have just 12 days to triple our voter outreach efforts and expose the real kyrsten sinema to the remaining undecided voters who will decide the outcome of this race , and with it control of the senate .
republican but advertising is so expensive , and we &apos;re running out of budget .
republican will you please chip in today — whatever amount you can afford — to help fund this last phase of our campaign ?
republican kyrsten sinema &apos;s campaign should take a lesson from this : don &apos;t try to pull a fast one on arizona &apos;s law enforcement , they &apos;ll catch you !

republican friend , why didn &apos;t appointed democrat senator tina smith show up for our scheduled debate last night ?
republican she &apos;s afraid to answer the questions our campaign has been asking .
republican we &apos;re sure she wouldn &apos;t want to answer for supporting the largest tax hike in minnesota history .
republican and we know she wouldn &apos;t want to touch how she profited from the terrible opioid crisis – or why she and her husband have hidden so much wealth in a bermuda tax haven .
republican but maybe she was just down at that tropical vacation spot – maybe she and her husband were out enjoying their ill-gotten &quot; good life &quot; in bermuda .
republican friend , there &apos;s no doubt about it – tina smith did not show up tonight because she can &apos;t defend her disastrous and self-serving political record .
republican just take a look at her record as an out-of-touch politician .
republican tina smith may be awol last night , but we still have so much work left to help push karin over the top on november 6th .
republican now it &apos;s time for us to show up at the polls and send her packing to bermuda for good .
republican while tina smith might have skipped tonight it due to her # bigcomplicatedschedule , karin will always show up and be read to answer questions from the people of minnesota !
republican to show karin you have her back in the final 15 days of this election , we &apos;ve set a goal of raising an additional $ 10,000 in the next 48 hours .
republican will you chip in $ 10 , $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 100 or more right now ?
republican washington doesn &apos;t need any more career politicians and it doesn &apos;t need empty podiums .
